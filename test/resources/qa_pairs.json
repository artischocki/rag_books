    },
    {
      "question": "Argue whether Myshkin’s innocence ultimately helps or harms those around him.",
      "answer": "Position A: His innocence uplifts and challenges others to confront their own failings, as with Aglaya’s growth. Position B: It naively enables abuse—Nastasya’s torment intensifies and Rogozhin’s obsession ends in violence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Compare the theme of redemption in The Idiot with that in another Dostoevsky novel (e.g., Crime and Punishment).",
      "answer": "In Crime and Punishment, redemption follows suffering and confession (Raskolnikov’s moral agony), whereas in The Idiot, it’s embodied by an almost Christ-like purity that feels both aspirational and painfully impractical."

      "question": "How might The Idiot read differently if told from Nastasya Filippovna’s perspective?",
      "answer": "We’d gain direct access to her trauma and inner conflict—her oscillation between contempt for her abusers and yearning for genuine love—making her self-destructive choices perhaps more sympathetic."
    },
    {
      "question": "Evaluate Dostoevsky’s use of “the idiot” as both a narrative device and a philosophical figure.",
      "answer": "As a device, Myshkin’s naive outsider status exposes societal hypocrisies; philosophically, he embodies the Christian ideal of agape, challenging readers to consider the costs and impossibility of pure goodness in an imperfect world."
