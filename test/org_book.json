            "Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.",
            "When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.",
            "One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent, ironical\u2014it might almost be called a malicious\u2014smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur\u2014or rather astrachan\u2014overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it\u2014the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy\u2014was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.",
            "The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as evidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.",
            "His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:",
            "\u201cCold?\u201d",
            "\u201cVery,\u201d said his neighbour, readily, \u201cand this is a thaw, too. Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old country. I\u2019ve grown quite out of the way of it.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, been abroad, I suppose?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, straight from Switzerland.\u201d",
            "\u201cWheugh! my goodness!\u201d The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then laughed.",
            "The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour\u2019s questions was surprising. He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him. Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady\u2014a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms. His interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more than ever, when to the question, \u201cwhether he had been cured?\u201d the patient replied:",
            "\u201cNo, they did not cure me.\u201d",
            "\u201cHey! that\u2019s it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe in those fellows, here!\u201d remarked the black-haired individual, sarcastically.",
            "\u201cGospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!\u201d exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. \u201cGospel truth! All they do is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but you\u2019re quite wrong in my particular instance,\u201d said the Swiss patient, quietly. \u201cOf course I can\u2019t argue the matter, because I know only my own case; but my doctor gave me money\u2014and he had very little\u2014to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while there, for nearly two years.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy? Was there no one else to pay for you?\u201d asked the black-haired one.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so eventually I came back.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd where have you come to?\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is\u2014where am I going to stay? I\u2014I really don\u2019t quite know yet, I\u2014\u201d",
            "Both the listeners laughed again.",
            "\u201cI suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?\u201d asked the first.",
            "\u201cI bet anything it is!\u201d exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme satisfaction, \u201cand that he has precious little in the luggage van!\u2014though of course poverty is no crime\u2014we must remember that!\u201d",
            "It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.",
            "\u201cYour bundle has some importance, however,\u201d continued the clerk, when they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); \u201cfor though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d\u2019or and louis d\u2019or\u2014judge from your costume and gaiters\u2014still\u2014if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin\u2019s, and have not made a little error through\u2014well, absence of mind, which is very common to human beings; or, say\u2014through a too luxuriant fancy?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, you are right again,\u201d said the fair-haired traveller, \u201cfor I really am _almost_ wrong when I say she and I are related. She is hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! you spent your postage for nothing, then. H\u2019m! you are candid, however\u2014and that is commendable. H\u2019m! Mrs. Epanchin\u2014oh yes! a most eminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in Switzerland, I know him too\u2014at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of that name? A fine fellow he was\u2014and had a property of four thousand souls in his day.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, Nicolai Andreevitch\u2014that was his name,\u201d and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with the red nose.",
            "This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. They are people who know everyone\u2014that is, they know where a man is employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc. These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge, which they reduce\u2014or raise\u2014to the standard of a science.",
            "During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man had become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted, and evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he would appear to listen\u2014and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.",
            "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle, rather suddenly; \u201cwhom have I the honour to be talking to?\u201d",
            "\u201cPrince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin,\u201d replied the latter, with perfect readiness.",
            "\u201cPrince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H\u2019m! I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person,\u201d said the clerk, thoughtfully. \u201cAt least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, in his history\u2014but as an individual\u2014one never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course not,\u201d replied the prince; \u201cthere are none, except myself. I believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don\u2019t know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?\u201d asked the black-haired passenger.",
            "\u201cOh yes\u2014I did learn a little, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve never learned anything whatever,\u201d said the other.",
            "\u201cOh, but I learned very little, you know!\u201d added the prince, as though excusing himself. \u201cThey could not teach me very much on account of my illness.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you know the Rogojins?\u201d asked his questioner, abruptly.",
            "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2014not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is that your name?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin.\u201d",
            "\u201cParfen Rogojin? dear me\u2014then don\u2019t you belong to those very Rogojins, perhaps\u2014\u201d began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone.",
            "\u201cYes\u2014those very ones,\u201d interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince.",
            "\u201cDear me\u2014is it possible?\u201d observed the clerk, while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility\u2014if not of absolute alarm: \u201cwhat, a son of that very Semen Rogojin\u2014hereditary honourable citizen\u2014who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles?\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd how do _you_ know that he left two million and a half of roubles?\u201d asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and not deigning so much as to look at the other. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s true enough that my father died a month ago, and that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot to my foot. They\u2019ve treated me like a dog! I\u2019ve been ill of fever at Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I received from my mother or my confounded brother!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd now you\u2019ll have a million roubles, at least\u2014goodness gracious me!\u201d exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.",
            "\u201cFive weeks since, I was just like yourself,\u201d continued Rogojin, addressing the prince, \u201cwith nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore. I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt\u2019s house, where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away. All honour to my respected father\u2019s memory\u2014but he uncommonly nearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn\u2019t cut and run then, when I did, he\u2019d have murdered me like a dog.\u201d",
            "\u201cI suppose you angered him somehow?\u201d asked the prince, looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity. But though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as safety-valve to his agitation.",
            "As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter\u2014since the information as to the identity of Rogojin\u2014hung over him, seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.",
            "\u201cOh, yes; I angered him\u2014I certainly did anger him,\u201d replied Rogojin. \u201cBut what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldn\u2019t do anything\u2014she\u2019s too old\u2014and whatever brother Senka says is law for her! But why couldn\u2019t he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. What\u2019s the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened, and there it\u2019s been ever since! It\u2019s only thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father\u2019s coffin, at night \u2018because they\u2019re worth a lot of money!\u2019 says he. Why, I can get him sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it\u2019s sacrilege. Here, you\u2014scarecrow!\u201d he added, addressing the clerk at his side, \u201cis it sacrilege or not, by law?\u201d",
            "\u201cSacrilege, certainly\u2014certainly sacrilege,\u201d said the latter.",
            "\u201cAnd it\u2019s Siberia for sacrilege, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
            "\u201cUndoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!\u201d",
            "\u201cThey will think that I\u2019m still ill,\u201d continued Rogojin to the prince, \u201cbut I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away. Aha, brother Senka, you\u2019ll have to open your gates and let me in, my boy! I know he told tales about me to my father\u2014I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that\u2019s very sure, and that was my own doing.\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna?\u201d said the clerk, as though trying to think out something.",
            "\u201cCome, you know nothing about _her_,\u201d said Rogojin, impatiently.",
            "\u201cAnd supposing I do know something?\u201d observed the other, triumphantly.",
            "\u201cBosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an impertinent beast you are!\u201d he added angrily. \u201cI thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I do know, as it happens,\u201d said the clerk in an aggravating manner. \u201cLebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all? Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s family name is Barashkoff\u2014I know, you see\u2014and she is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy eyes!\u201d said Rogojin, really surprised at last. \u201cThe devil take the fellow, how does he know that?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, he knows everything\u2014Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month or two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he was knocking about\u2014he\u2019s in the debtor\u2019s prison now\u2014I was with him, and he couldn\u2019t do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia Philipovna and several people at that time.\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna? Why, you don\u2019t mean to say that she and Lihachof\u2014\u201d cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.",
            "\u201cNo, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!\u201d said Lebedeff, hastily. \u201cOh dear no, not for the world! Totski\u2019s the only man with any chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the French theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and say, \u2018By Jove, there\u2019s the famous Nastasia Philipovna!\u2019 but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, it\u2019s quite true,\u201d said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; \u201cso Zaleshoff told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my father\u2019s old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met Zaleshoff\u2014looking like a hair-dresser\u2019s assistant, got up as fine as I don\u2019t know who, while I looked like a tinker. \u2018Don\u2019t flatter yourself, my boy,\u2019 said he; \u2018she\u2019s not for such as you; she\u2019s a princess, she is, and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he\u2019s growing rather old\u2014fifty-five or so\u2014and wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.\u2019 And then he told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described which was her box. Well, I\u2019d like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre; he\u2019d sooner have killed us, any day. However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a wink all night after. Next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each. \u2018Sell them,\u2019 said he, \u2018and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.\u2019 Well, I sold the bonds, but I didn\u2019t take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at once to Zaleshoff\u2019s. \u2018Come on!\u2019 I said, \u2018come on to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s,\u2019 and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadn\u2019t a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to us.",
            "\u201cI didn\u2019t say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: \u2018From Parfen Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind as to accept these!\u2019",
            "\u201cShe opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.",
            "\u201c\u2018Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,\u2019 says she, and bowed and went off. Why didn\u2019t I die there on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!",
            "\u201c\u2018Look here now,\u2019 I said, when we came out, \u2018none of your interference here after this\u2014do you understand?\u2019 He laughed: \u2018And how are you going to settle up with your father?\u2019 says he. I thought I might as well jump into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I wouldn\u2019t, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy goodness!\u201d shivered the clerk. \u201cAnd his father,\u201d he added, for the prince\u2019s instruction, \u201cand his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day\u2014not to speak of ten thousand!\u201d",
            "The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than ever at this moment.",
            "\u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d cried the latter. \u201cWell, my father learned the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an hour. \u2018This is only a foretaste,\u2019 says he; \u2018wait a bit till night comes, and I\u2019ll come back and talk to you again.\u2019",
            "\u201cWell, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. \u2018There,\u2019 she says, \u2018take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,\u2019 she says, \u2018and thank him very much!\u2019 Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my aunt\u2019s. The old woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other!\u201d",
            "\u201cOho! we\u2019ll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!\u201d giggled Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. \u201cHey, my boy, we\u2019ll get her some proper earrings now! We\u2019ll get her such earrings that\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cLook here,\u201d cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, \u201clook here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I\u2019ll tan your hide as sure as you sit there!\u201d",
            "\u201cAha! do\u2014by all means! if you tan my hide you won\u2019t turn me away from your society. You\u2019ll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha, ha! here we are at the station, though.\u201d",
            "Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.",
            "Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting.",
            "\u201cWhy, there\u2019s Zaleshoff here, too!\u201d he muttered, gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned to the prince: \u201cPrince, I don\u2019t know why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps because I met you just when I did. But no, it can\u2019t be that, for I met this fellow\u201d (nodding at Lebedeff) \u201ctoo, and I have not taken a fancy to him by any means. Come to see me, prince; we\u2019ll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat, anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s. Now then will you come or no?\u201d",
            "\u201cAccept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch\u201d said Lebedef solemnly; \u201cdon\u2019t let it slip! Accept, quick!\u201d",
            "Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:",
            "\u201cI will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so come along!\u201d",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s true enough, he\u2019ll have lots before evening!\u201d put in Lebedeff.",

            "\u201cOh no, oh no!\u201d said the prince; \u201cI couldn\u2019t, you know\u2014my illness\u2014I hardly ever saw a soul.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! well\u2014here, you fellow\u2014you can come along with me now if you like!\u201d cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.",
            "Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin\u2019s friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince\u2019s route lay towards the Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he determined to take a droshky. "

        "II.": [
            "This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own little weaknesses\u2014very excusable ones,\u2014one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and because \u201che knew his place.\u201d And yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who \u201cknew his place\u201d so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people\u2019s ideas rather than his own. And also, his luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in very varied society.",
            "As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is, about fifty-five years of age,\u2014the flowering time of existence, when real enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour, sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters. He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important accumulations. The general never regretted his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs. Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely proud of her descent.",
            "With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she took her place among the higher circles as by right.",
            "During these last few years all three of the general\u2019s daughters\u2014Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya\u2014had grown up and matured. Of course they were only Epanchins, but their mother\u2019s family was noble; they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country\u2019s service\u2014all of which was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not all, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.",
            "It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked asserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value. The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke well of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read.",
            "They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not too keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.",
            "It was about eleven o\u2019clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at General Epanchin\u2019s door. The general lived on the first floor or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance, looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined the general\u2019s study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning, and announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the general\u2019s special study servant, and well aware of his own importance.",
            "\u201cWait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here,\u201d said the door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the ante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I would rather sit here with you,\u201d said the prince; \u201cI should prefer it to sitting in there.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but you can\u2019t stay here. You are a visitor\u2014a guest, so to speak. Is it the general himself you wish to see?\u201d",
            "The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby-looking visitor, and had decided to ask once more.",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I have business\u2014\u201d began the prince.",
            "\u201cI do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that.\u201d",
            "The man\u2019s suspicions seemed to increase more and more. The prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general certainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. The presence of the secretary as an intermediary was, he judged, essential in this case.",
            "\u201cSurely you\u2014are from abroad?\u201d he inquired at last, in a confused sort of way. He had begun his sentence intending to say, \u201cSurely you are not Prince Muishkin, are you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, \u2018Surely you are not Prince Muishkin?\u2019 just now, but refrained out of politeness?\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m!\u201d grunted the astonished servant.",
            "\u201cI assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for me. As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there\u2019s nothing surprising in that\u2014the fact is, my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m!\u2014no, I\u2019m not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you, that\u2019s all. The secretary will be out directly\u2014that is, unless you\u2014yes, that\u2019s the rub\u2014unless you\u2014come, you must allow me to ask you\u2014you\u2019ve not come to beg, have you?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite another matter on hand.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to think\u2014but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh\u2014well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me.\u201d",
            "\u201c_Smoke?_\u201d said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses. \u201cNo, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean in this room! I know I can\u2019t smoke here, of course. I\u2019d adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You see, I\u2019m used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven\u2019t had a puff for three hours; however, just as you like.\u201d",
            "\u201cNow how on earth am I to announce a man like that?\u201d muttered the servant. \u201cIn the first place, you\u2019ve no right in here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because you\u2019re a sort of visitor\u2014a guest, in fact\u2014and I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?\u201d he added, glancing once more at the prince\u2019s bundle, which evidently gave him no peace.",
            "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think I should stay even if they were to invite me. I\u2019ve simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more.\u201d",
            "\u201cMake their acquaintance?\u201d asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled suspicion. \u201cThen why did you say you had business with the general?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh well, very little business. There is one little matter\u2014some advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there are no other Muishkins left.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat\u2014you\u2019re a relation then, are you?\u201d asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.",
            "\u201cWell, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough. If I am received\u2014very good; if not, well, very good again. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed.\u201d",
            "The prince\u2019s conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving-man this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation\u2014either that this was a begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and talk of his own private affairs like this. In either case, how was he to announce this singular visitor?",
            "\u201cI really think I must request you to step into the next room!\u201d he said, with all the insistence he could muster.",
            "\u201cWhy? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. Don\u2019t you think you might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come out?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no! I can\u2019t announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed\u2014he is with the Colonel C\u2014. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing.\u201d",
            "\u201cWho may that be? a clerk?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the companies. Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I will if I may; and\u2014can I take off my cloak\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course; you can\u2019t go in _there_ with it on, anyhow.\u201d",
            "The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning costume\u2014a little worn, but well made. He wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch. Fool the prince might be, still, the general\u2019s servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow.",
            "\u201cAnd what time of day does the lady receive?\u201d the latter asked, reseating himself in his old place.",
            "\u201cOh, that\u2019s not in _my_ province! I believe she receives at any time; it depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes in at eleven. Gavrila Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is even admitted to early lunch now and then.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season,\u201d observed the prince; \u201cbut it is much warmer there out of doors. As for the houses\u2014a Russian can\u2019t live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them.\u201d",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t they heat them at all?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so different to ours.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! were you long away?\u201d",
            "\u201cFour years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,\u2014in one village.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou must have forgotten Russia, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, indeed I had\u2014a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself \u2018how well I am speaking it.\u2019 Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking Russian.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?\u201d",
            "This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.",
            "\u201cIn Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. They talk a good deal about the new law courts, and changes there, don\u2019t they?\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! yes, that\u2019s true enough. Well now, how is the law over there, do they administer it more justly than here?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know about that! I\u2019ve heard much that is good about our legal administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one thing.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs there over there?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I saw an execution in France\u2014at Lyons. Schneider took me over with him to see it.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, did they hang the fellow?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, they cut off people\u2019s heads in France.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat did the fellow do?\u2014yell?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no\u2014it\u2019s the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery\u2014they call the thing a guillotine\u2014it falls with fearful force and weight\u2014the head springs off so quickly that you can\u2019t wink your eye in between. But all the preparations are so dreadful. When they announce the sentence, you know, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the scaffold\u2014that\u2019s the fearful part of the business. The people all crowd round\u2014even women\u2014though they don\u2019t at all approve of women looking on.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a thing for women.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course not\u2014of course not!\u2014bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you\u2014believe it or not, as you like\u2014that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he _cried_, he did indeed,\u2014he was as white as a bit of paper. Isn\u2019t it a dreadful idea that he should have cried\u2014cried! Whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear\u2014not a child, but a man who never had cried before\u2014a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what must have been going on in that man\u2019s mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that\u2019s what it is. Because it is said \u2018thou shalt not kill,\u2019 is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it\u2019s an impossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it\u2019s dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it, often.\u201d",
            "The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. The servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. Clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. Who knows? Perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought.",
            "\u201cWell, at all events it is a good thing that there\u2019s no pain when the poor fellow\u2019s head flies off,\u201d he remarked.",
            "\u201cDo you know, though,\u201d cried the prince warmly, \u201cyou made that remark now, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh at my idea, perhaps\u2014but I could not help its occurring to me all the same. Now with the rack and tortures and so on\u2014you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until you die. But _here_ I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all\u2014but the certain knowledge that in an hour,\u2014then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now\u2014this very _instant_\u2014your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man\u2014and that this is certain, _certain!_ That\u2019s the point\u2014the certainty of it. Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head\u2014then\u2014that quarter of a second is the most awful of all.",
            "\u201cThis is not my own fantastical opinion\u2014many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I\u2019ll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy\u2014at all events hoping on in some degree\u2014even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope\u2014having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,\u2014is taken away from the wretch and _certainty_ substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death\u2014which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon\u2019s mouth in battle, and fire upon him\u2014and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary\u2014why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no man!\u201d",
            "The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. \u201cIf you are really very anxious for a smoke,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it. You see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn\u2019t be on the spot. You see that door there? Go in there and you\u2019ll find a little room on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really, and\u2014.\u201d But there was no time, after all.",
            "A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of papers in his hand. The footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat. The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.",
            "\u201cThis gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,\u201d began the man, confidentially and almost familiarly, \u201cthat he is Prince Muishkin and a relative of Madame Epanchin\u2019s. He has just arrived from abroad, with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage\u2014.\u201d",
            "The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper.",

            "\u201cAre you Prince Muishkin?\u201d he asked, with the greatest courtesy and amiability.",
            "He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers, fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most intelligent. Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable.",
            "\u201cProbably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles at all!\u201d thought the prince.",
            "He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.",

            "\u201cOh, I have no special business; my principal object was to make your acquaintance. I should not like to disturb you. I do not know your times and arrangements here, you see, but I have only just arrived. I came straight from the station. I am come direct from Switzerland.\u201d",
            "The general very nearly smiled, but thought better of it and kept his smile back. Then he reflected, blinked his eyes, stared at his guest once more from head to foot; then abruptly motioned him to a chair, sat down himself, and waited with some impatience for the prince to speak.",
            "Gania stood at his table in the far corner of the room, turning over papers.",
            "\u201cI have not much time for making acquaintances, as a rule,\u201d said the general, \u201cbut as, of course, you have your object in coming, I\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI felt sure you would think I had some object in view when I resolved to pay you this visit,\u201d the prince interrupted; \u201cbut I give you my word, beyond the pleasure of making your acquaintance I had no personal object whatever.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe pleasure is, of course, mutual; but life is not all pleasure, as you are aware. There is such a thing as business, and I really do not see what possible reason there can be, or what we have in common to\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, there is no reason, of course, and I suppose there is nothing in common between us, or very little; for if I am Prince Muishkin, and your wife happens to be a member of my house, that can hardly be called a \u2018reason.\u2019 I quite understand that. And yet that was my whole motive for coming. You see I have not been in Russia for four years, and knew very little about anything when I left. I had been very ill for a long time, and I feel now the need of a few good friends. In fact, I have a certain question upon which I much need advice, and do not know whom to go to for it. I thought of your family when I was passing through Berlin. \u2018They are almost relations,\u2019 I said to myself, \u2018so I\u2019ll begin with them; perhaps we may get on with each other, I with them and they with me, if they are kind people;\u2019 and I have heard that you are very kind people!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, thank you, thank you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d replied the general, considerably taken aback. \u201cMay I ask where you have taken up your quarters?\u201d",
            "\u201cNowhere, as yet.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, straight from the station to my house? And how about your luggage?\u201d",
            "\u201cI only had a small bundle, containing linen, with me, nothing more. I can carry it in my hand, easily. There will be plenty of time to take a room in some hotel by the evening.\u201d",

            "\u201cThat could only have been on your invitation. I confess, however, that I should not have stayed here even if you had invited me, not for any particular reason, but because it is\u2014well, contrary to my practice and nature, somehow.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, indeed! Then it is perhaps as well that I neither _did_ invite you, nor _do_ invite you now. Excuse me, prince, but we had better make this matter clear, once for all. We have just agreed that with regard to our relationship there is not much to be said, though, of course, it would have been very delightful to us to feel that such relationship did actually exist; therefore, perhaps\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cTherefore, perhaps I had better get up and go away?\u201d said the prince, laughing merrily as he rose from his place; just as merrily as though the circumstances were by no means strained or difficult. \u201cAnd I give you my word, general, that though I know nothing whatever of manners and customs of society, and how people live and all that, yet I felt quite sure that this visit of mine would end exactly as it has ended now. Oh, well, I suppose it\u2019s all right; especially as my letter was not answered. Well, good-bye, and forgive me for having disturbed you!\u201d",
            "The prince\u2019s expression was so good-natured at this moment, and so entirely free from even a suspicion of unpleasant feeling was the smile with which he looked at the general as he spoke, that the latter suddenly paused, and appeared to gaze at his guest from quite a new point of view, all in an instant.",
            "\u201cDo you know, prince,\u201d he said, in quite a different tone, \u201cI do not know you at all, yet, and after all, Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely be pleased to have a peep at a man of her own name. Wait a little, if you don\u2019t mind, and if you have time to spare?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I assure you I\u2019ve lots of time, my time is entirely my own!\u201d And the prince immediately replaced his soft, round hat on the table. \u201cI confess, I thought Elizabetha Prokofievna would very likely remember that I had written her a letter. Just now your servant\u2014outside there\u2014was dreadfully suspicious that I had come to beg of you. I noticed that! Probably he has very strict instructions on that score; but I assure you I did not come to beg. I came to make some friends. But I am rather bothered at having disturbed you; that\u2019s all I care about.\u2014\u201d",

Besides, you and I are so differently constituted, I should think, that there must be very little in common between us. Not that I will ever believe there is _nothing_ in common between any two people, as some declare is the case. I am sure people make a great mistake in sorting each other into groups, by appearances; but I am boring you, I see, you\u2014\u201d",

            "\u201cOh, my dear sir, I esteem and understand your kindness in putting the question. No; at present I have no means whatever, and no employment either, but I hope to find some. I was living on other people abroad. Schneider, the professor who treated me and taught me, too, in Switzerland, gave me just enough money for my journey, so that now I have but a few copecks left. There certainly is one question upon which I am anxious to have advice, but\u2014\u201d",

            "\u201cOh, don\u2019t apologize. No, I don\u2019t think I have either talents or special abilities of any kind; on the contrary. I have always been an invalid and unable to learn much. As for bread, I should think\u2014\u201d",
            "The general interrupted once more with questions; while the prince again replied with the narrative we have heard before. It appeared that the general had known Pavlicheff; but why the latter had taken an interest in the prince, that young gentleman could not explain; probably by virtue of the old friendship with his father, he thought.",
            "The prince had been left an orphan when quite a little child, and Pavlicheff had entrusted him to an old lady, a relative of his own, living in the country, the child needing the fresh air and exercise of country life. He was educated, first by a governess, and afterwards by a tutor, but could not remember much about this time of his life. His fits were so frequent then, that they made almost an idiot of him (the prince used the expression \u201cidiot\u201d himself). Pavlicheff had met Professor Schneider in Berlin, and the latter had persuaded him to send the boy to Switzerland, to Schneider\u2019s establishment there, for the cure of his epilepsy, and, five years before this time, the prince was sent off. But Pavlicheff had died two or three years since, and Schneider had himself supported the young fellow, from that day to this, at his own expense. Although he had not quite cured him, he had greatly improved his condition; and now, at last, at the prince\u2019s own desire, and because of a certain matter which came to the ears of the latter, Schneider had despatched the young man to Russia.",
            "The general was much astonished.",
            "\u201cThen you have no one, absolutely _no_ one in Russia?\u201d he asked.",
            "\u201cNo one, at present; but I hope to make friends; and then I have a letter from\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cAt all events,\u201d put in the general, not listening to the news about the letter, \u201cat all events, you must have learned _something_, and your malady would not prevent your undertaking some easy work, in one of the departments, for instance?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh dear no, oh no! As for a situation, I should much like to find one for I am anxious to discover what I really am fit for. I have learned a good deal in the last four years, and, besides, I read a great many Russian books.\u201d",
            "\u201cRussian books, indeed? Then, of course, you can read and write quite correctly?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh dear, yes!\u201d",
            "\u201cCapital! And your handwriting?\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, there I am _really_ talented! I may say I am a real caligraphist. Let me write you something, just to show you,\u201d said the prince, with some excitement.",
            "\u201cWith pleasure! In fact, it is very necessary. I like your readiness, prince; in fact, I must say\u2014I\u2014I\u2014like you very well, altogether,\u201d said the general.",
            "\u201cWhat delightful writing materials you have here, such a lot of pencils and things, and what beautiful paper! It\u2019s a charming room altogether. I know that picture, it\u2019s a Swiss view. I\u2019m sure the artist painted it from nature, and that I have seen the very place\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite likely, though I bought it here. Gania, give the prince some paper. Here are pens and paper; now then, take this table. What\u2019s this?\u201d the general continued to Gania, who had that moment taken a large photograph out of his portfolio, and shown it to his senior. \u201cHalloa! Nastasia Philipovna! Did she send it you herself? Herself?\u201d he inquired, with much curiosity and great animation.",
            "\u201cShe gave it me just now, when I called in to congratulate her. I asked her for it long ago. I don\u2019t know whether she meant it for a hint that I had come empty-handed, without a present for her birthday, or what,\u201d added Gania, with an unpleasant smile.",
            "\u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense,\u201d said the general, with decision. \u201cWhat extraordinary ideas you have, Gania! As if she would hint; that\u2019s not her way at all. Besides, what could _you_ give her, without having thousands at your disposal? You might have given her your portrait, however. Has she ever asked you for it?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, not yet. Very likely she never will. I suppose you haven\u2019t forgotten about tonight, have you, Ivan Fedorovitch? You were one of those specially invited, you know.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no, I remember all right, and I shall go, of course. I should think so! She\u2019s twenty-five years old today! And, you know, Gania, you must be ready for great things; she has promised both myself and Afanasy Ivanovitch that she will give a decided answer tonight, yes or no. So be prepared!\u201d",
            "Gania suddenly became so ill at ease that his face grew paler than ever.",
            "\u201cAre you sure she said that?\u201d he asked, and his voice seemed to quiver as he spoke.",
            "\u201cYes, she promised. We both worried her so that she gave in; but she wished us to tell you nothing about it until the day.\u201d",
            "The general watched Gania\u2019s confusion intently, and clearly did not like it.",
            "\u201cRemember, Ivan Fedorovitch,\u201d said Gania, in great agitation, \u201cthat I was to be free too, until her decision; and that even then I was to have my \u2018yes or no\u2019 free.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you, aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d began the general, in alarm.",
            "\u201cOh, don\u2019t misunderstand\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cBut, my dear fellow, what are you doing, what do you mean?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I\u2019m not rejecting her. I may have expressed myself badly, but I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d",
            "\u201cReject her! I should think not!\u201d said the general with annoyance, and apparently not in the least anxious to conceal it. \u201cWhy, my dear fellow, it\u2019s not a question of your rejecting her, it is whether you are prepared to receive her consent joyfully, and with proper satisfaction. How are things going on at home?\u201d",
            "\u201cAt home? Oh, I can do as I like there, of course; only my father will make a fool of himself, as usual. He is rapidly becoming a general nuisance. I don\u2019t ever talk to him now, but I hold him in check, safe enough. I swear if it had not been for my mother, I should have shown him the way out, long ago. My mother is always crying, of course, and my sister sulks. I had to tell them at last that I intended to be master of my own destiny, and that I expect to be obeyed at home. At least, I gave my sister to understand as much, and my mother was present.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I must say, I cannot understand it!\u201d said the general, shrugging his shoulders and dropping his hands. \u201cYou remember your mother, Nina Alexandrovna, that day she came and sat here and groaned\u2014and when I asked her what was the matter, she says, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s such a _dishonour_ to us!\u2019 dishonour! Stuff and nonsense! I should like to know who can reproach Nastasia Philipovna, or who can say a word of any kind against her. Did she mean because Nastasia had been living with Totski? What nonsense it is! You would not let her come near your daughters, says Nina Alexandrovna. What next, I wonder? I don\u2019t see how she can fail to\u2014to understand\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cHer own position?\u201d prompted Gania. \u201cShe does understand. Don\u2019t be annoyed with her. I have warned her not to meddle in other people\u2019s affairs. However, although there\u2019s comparative peace at home at present, the storm will break if anything is finally settled tonight.\u201d",
            "The prince heard the whole of the foregoing conversation, as he sat at the table, writing. He finished at last, and brought the result of his labour to the general\u2019s desk.",
            "\u201cSo this is Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he said, looking attentively and curiously at the portrait. \u201cHow wonderfully beautiful!\u201d he immediately added, with warmth. The picture was certainly that of an unusually lovely woman. She was photographed in a black silk dress of simple design, her hair was evidently dark and plainly arranged, her eyes were deep and thoughtful, the expression of her face passionate, but proud. She was rather thin, perhaps, and a little pale. Both Gania and the general gazed at the prince in amazement.",
            "\u201cHow do you know it\u2019s Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked the general; \u201cyou surely don\u2019t know her already, do you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I do! I have only been one day in Russia, but I have heard of the great beauty!\u201d And the prince proceeded to narrate his meeting with Rogojin in the train and the whole of the latter\u2019s story.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s news!\u201d said the general in some excitement, after listening to the story with engrossed attention.",
            "\u201cOh, of course it\u2019s nothing but humbug!\u201d cried Gania, a little disturbed, however. \u201cIt\u2019s all humbug; the young merchant was pleased to indulge in a little innocent recreation! I have heard something of Rogojin!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, so have I!\u201d replied the general. \u201cNastasia Philipovna told us all about the earrings that very day. But now it is quite a different matter. You see the fellow really has a million of roubles, and he is passionately in love. The whole story smells of passion, and we all know what this class of gentry is capable of when infatuated. I am much afraid of some disagreeable scandal, I am indeed!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are afraid of the million, I suppose,\u201d said Gania, grinning and showing his teeth.",
            "\u201cAnd you are _not_, I presume, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cHow did he strike you, prince?\u201d asked Gania, suddenly. \u201cDid he seem to be a serious sort of a man, or just a common rowdy fellow? What was your own opinion about the matter?\u201d",
            "While Gania put this question, a new idea suddenly flashed into his brain, and blazed out, impatiently, in his eyes. The general, who was really agitated and disturbed, looked at the prince too, but did not seem to expect much from his reply.",
            "\u201cI really don\u2019t quite know how to tell you,\u201d replied the prince, \u201cbut it certainly did seem to me that the man was full of passion, and not, perhaps, quite healthy passion. He seemed to be still far from well. Very likely he will be in bed again in a day or two, especially if he lives fast.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo! do you think so?\u201d said the general, catching at the idea.",
            "\u201cYes, I do think so!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, but the sort of scandal I referred to may happen at any moment. It may be this very evening,\u201d remarked Gania to the general, with a smile.",
            "\u201cOf course; quite so. In that case it all depends upon what is going on in her brain at this moment.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou know the kind of person she is at times.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow? What kind of person is she?\u201d cried the general, arrived at the limits of his patience. \u201cLook here, Gania, don\u2019t you go annoying her tonight. What you are to do is to be as agreeable towards her as ever you can. Well, what are you smiling at? You must understand, Gania, that I have no interest whatever in speaking like this. Whichever way the question is settled, it will be to my advantage. Nothing will move Totski from his resolution, so I run no risk. If there is anything I desire, you must know that it is your benefit only. Can\u2019t you trust me? You are a sensible fellow, and I have been counting on you; for, in this matter, that, that\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, that\u2019s the chief thing,\u201d said Gania, helping the general out of his difficulties again, and curling his lips in an envenomed smile, which he did not attempt to conceal. He gazed with his fevered eyes straight into those of the general, as though he were anxious that the latter might read his thoughts.",
            "The general grew purple with anger.",
            "\u201cYes, of course it is the chief thing!\u201d he cried, looking sharply at Gania. \u201cWhat a very curious man you are, Gania! You actually seem to be _glad_ to hear of this millionaire fellow\u2019s arrival\u2014just as though you wished for an excuse to get out of the whole thing. This is an affair in which you ought to act honestly with both sides, and give due warning, to avoid compromising others. But, even now, there is still time. Do you understand me? I wish to know whether you desire this arrangement or whether you do not? If not, say so,\u2014and\u2014and welcome! No one is trying to force you into the snare, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, if you see a snare in the matter, at least.\u201d",
            "\u201cI do desire it,\u201d murmured Gania, softly but firmly, lowering his eyes; and he relapsed into gloomy silence.",
            "The general was satisfied. He had excited himself, and was evidently now regretting that he had gone so far. He turned to the prince, and suddenly the disagreeable thought of the latter\u2019s presence struck him, and the certainty that he must have heard every word of the conversation. But he felt at ease in another moment; it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.",
            "\u201cOh!\u201d cried the general, catching sight of the prince\u2019s specimen of caligraphy, which the latter had now handed him for inspection. \u201cWhy, this is simply beautiful; look at that, Gania, there\u2019s real talent there!\u201d",
            "On a sheet of thick writing-paper the prince had written in medieval characters the legend:",
            "\u201cThe gentle Abbot Pafnute signed this.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere,\u201d explained the prince, with great delight and animation, \u201cthere, that\u2019s the abbot\u2019s real signature\u2014from a manuscript of the fourteenth century. All these old abbots and bishops used to write most beautifully, with such taste and so much care and diligence. Have you no copy of Pogodin, general? If you had one I could show you another type. Stop a bit\u2014here you have the large round writing common in France during the eighteenth century. Some of the letters are shaped quite differently from those now in use. It was the writing current then, and employed by public writers generally. I copied this from one of them, and you can see how good it is. Look at the well-rounded a and d. I have tried to translate the French character into the Russian letters\u2014a difficult thing to do, but I think I have succeeded fairly. Here is a fine sentence, written in a good, original hand\u2014\u2018Zeal triumphs over all.\u2019 That is the script of the Russian War Office. That is how official documents addressed to important personages should be written. The letters are round, the type black, and the style somewhat remarkable. A stylist would not allow these ornaments, or attempts at flourishes\u2014just look at these unfinished tails!\u2014but it has distinction and really depicts the soul of the writer. He would like to give play to his imagination, and follow the inspiration of his genius, but a soldier is only at ease in the guard-room, and the pen stops half-way, a slave to discipline. How delightful! The first time I met an example of this handwriting, I was positively astonished, and where do you think I chanced to find it? In Switzerland, of all places! Now that is an ordinary English hand. It can hardly be improved, it is so refined and exquisite\u2014almost perfection. This is an example of another kind, a mixture of styles. The copy was given me by a French commercial traveller. It is founded on the English, but the downstrokes are a little blacker, and more marked. Notice that the oval has some slight modification\u2014it is more rounded. This writing allows for flourishes; now a flourish is a dangerous thing! Its use requires such taste, but, if successful, what a distinction it gives to the whole! It results in an incomparable type\u2014one to fall in love with!\u201d",
            "\u201cDear me! How you have gone into all the refinements and details of the question! Why, my dear fellow, you are not a caligraphist, you are an artist! Eh, Gania?\u201d",
            "\u201cWonderful!\u201d said Gania. \u201cAnd he knows it too,\u201d he added, with a sarcastic smile.",
            "\u201cYou may smile,\u2014but there\u2019s a career in this,\u201d said the general. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a great personage I shall show this to, prince. Why, you can command a situation at thirty-five roubles per month to start with. However, it\u2019s half-past twelve,\u201d he concluded, looking at his watch; \u201cso to business, prince, for I must be setting to work and shall not see you again today. Sit down a minute. I have told you that I cannot receive you myself very often, but I should like to be of some assistance to you, some small assistance, of a kind that would give you satisfaction. I shall find you a place in one of the State departments, an easy place\u2014but you will require to be accurate. Now, as to your plans\u2014in the house, or rather in the family of Gania here\u2014my young friend, whom I hope you will know better\u2014his mother and sister have prepared two or three rooms for lodgers, and let them to highly recommended young fellows, with board and attendance. I am sure Nina Alexandrovna will take you in on my recommendation. There you will be comfortable and well taken care of; for I do not think, prince, that you are the sort of man to be left to the mercy of Fate in a town like Petersburg. Nina Alexandrovna, Gania\u2019s mother, and Varvara Alexandrovna, are ladies for whom I have the highest possible esteem and respect. Nina Alexandrovna is the wife of General Ardalion Alexandrovitch, my old brother in arms, with whom, I regret to say, on account of certain circumstances, I am no longer acquainted. I give you all this information, prince, in order to make it clear to you that I am personally recommending you to this family, and that in so doing, I am more or less taking upon myself to answer for you. The terms are most reasonable, and I trust that your salary will very shortly prove amply sufficient for your expenditure. Of course pocket-money is a necessity, if only a little; do not be angry, prince, if I strongly recommend you to avoid carrying money in your pocket. But as your purse is quite empty at the present moment, you must allow me to press these twenty-five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with. Of course we will settle this little matter another time, and if you are the upright, honest man you look, I anticipate very little trouble between us on that score. Taking so much interest in you as you may perceive I do, I am not without my object, and you shall know it in good time. You see, I am perfectly candid with you. I hope, Gania, you have nothing to say against the prince\u2019s taking up his abode in your house?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, on the contrary! my mother will be very glad,\u201d said Gania, courteously and kindly.",
            "\u201cI think only one of your rooms is engaged as yet, is it not? That fellow Ferd-Ferd\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cFerdishenko.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I don\u2019t like that Ferdishenko. I can\u2019t understand why Nastasia Philipovna encourages him so. Is he really her cousin, as he says?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh dear no, it\u2019s all a joke. No more cousin than I am.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, what do you think of the arrangement, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cThank you, general; you have behaved very kindly to me; all the more so since I did not ask you to help me. I don\u2019t say that out of pride. I certainly did not know where to lay my head tonight. Rogojin asked me to come to his house, of course, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cRogojin? No, no, my good fellow. I should strongly recommend you, paternally,\u2014or, if you prefer it, as a friend,\u2014to forget all about Rogojin, and, in fact, to stick to the family into which you are about to enter.\u201d",
            "\u201cThank you,\u201d began the prince; \u201cand since you are so very kind there is just one matter which I\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYou must really excuse me,\u201d interrupted the general, \u201cbut I positively haven\u2019t another moment now. I shall just tell Elizabetha Prokofievna about you, and if she wishes to receive you at once\u2014as I shall advise her\u2014I strongly recommend you to ingratiate yourself with her at the first opportunity, for my wife may be of the greatest service to you in many ways. If she cannot receive you now, you must be content to wait till another time. Meanwhile you, Gania, just look over these accounts, will you? We mustn\u2019t forget to finish off that matter\u2014\u201d",
            "The general left the room, and the prince never succeeded in broaching the business which he had on hand, though he had endeavoured to do so four times.",
            "Gania lit a cigarette and offered one to the prince. The latter accepted the offer, but did not talk, being unwilling to disturb Gania\u2019s work. He commenced to examine the study and its contents. But Gania hardly so much as glanced at the papers lying before him; he was absent and thoughtful, and his smile and general appearance struck the prince still more disagreeably now that the two were left alone together.",
            "Suddenly Gania approached our hero who was at the moment standing over Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s portrait, gazing at it.",
            "\u201cDo you admire that sort of woman, prince?\u201d he asked, looking intently at him. He seemed to have some special object in the question.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful face,\u201d said the prince, \u201cand I feel sure that her destiny is not by any means an ordinary, uneventful one. Her face is smiling enough, but she must have suffered terribly\u2014hasn\u2019t she? Her eyes show it\u2014those two bones there, the little points under her eyes, just where the cheek begins. It\u2019s a proud face too, terribly proud! And I\u2014I can\u2019t say whether she is good and kind, or not. Oh, if she be but good! That would make all well!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd would you marry a woman like that, now?\u201d continued Gania, never taking his excited eyes off the prince\u2019s face.",
            "\u201cI cannot marry at all,\u201d said the latter. \u201cI am an invalid.\u201d",
            "\u201cWould Rogojin marry her, do you think?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy not? Certainly he would, I should think. He would marry her tomorrow!\u2014marry her tomorrow and murder her in a week!\u201d",
            "Hardly had the prince uttered the last word when Gania gave such a fearful shudder that the prince almost cried out.",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he, seizing Gania\u2019s hand.",
            "\u201cYour highness! His excellency begs your presence in her excellency\u2019s apartments!\u201d announced the footman, appearing at the door.",
            "The prince immediately followed the man out of the room. "

        "IV.": [
            "Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the fact.",
            "It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o\u2019clock, while still in bed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.",
            "Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on, there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.",
            "On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general\u2019s appearance, the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been one moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.",
            "As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not altogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in their expression as well.",
            "The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.",
            "However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin\u2019s family and others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that, an experienced and talented husband and father. Among other things, he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up daughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because unnatural; but the general\u2019s arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts. The general considered that the girls\u2019 taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and that the parents\u2019 duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that the selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached.",
            "Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins\u2019 position gained each year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better was their chance of making a brilliant match.",
            "But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty.",
            "Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general\u2019s daughters?",
            "Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.",
            "The undoubted beauty of the family, _par excellence_, was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he.",
            "Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated Aglaya\u2019s chances of happiness. In their opinion, the latter\u2019s destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth. Aglaya\u2019s husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need be, for Aglaya\u2019s sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.",
            "The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore, when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The general valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized what such an offer was worth.",
            "The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive, at least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest, Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.",
            "Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own. She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What better could Totski wish?",
            "So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandra\u2019s parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business.",
            "This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close to an estate of Totski\u2019s, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.",
            "Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls\u2014two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,\u2014were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left\u2014Nastasia Philipovna\u2014for the other little one died of whooping-cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff\u2019s house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality\u2014as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.",
            "He only stayed at his country seat a few days on this occasion, but he had time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the child\u2019s education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and culture. For four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete. The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch Nastia, by Totski\u2019s instructions. The child was now transported to another of Totski\u2019s estates in a distant part of the country. Here she found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. In the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all sorts, a charming \u201cyoung lady\u2019s library,\u201d pictures, paint-boxes, a lap-dog, and everything to make life agreeable. Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings.",
            "At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski\u2019s last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski\u2019s house, all alone.",
            "The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in common.",
            "In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not from her \u201cyoung lady\u2019s library\u201d? It even embraced legal matters, and the \u201cworld\u201d in general, to a considerable extent.",
            "Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the reveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except loathing and contempt\u2014contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him.",
            "This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to prevent this marriage\u2014for no particular reason, but that she _chose_ to do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was \u201cquite her turn to laugh a little now!\u201d",
            "Such were her words\u2014very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation she deigned to offer.",
            "Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!",
            "At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.",
            "There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom or what, some insatiable contempt\u2014in a word, something altogether absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.",
            "For a man of Totski\u2019s wealth and standing, it would, of course, have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. She was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity.",
            "Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world\u2014herself least of all\u2014and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. For instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.",
            "He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo, Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She was pretty then... but now!... Totski laughed angrily when he thought how short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered. She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing, now!",
            "However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. In this way he might gain glory in certain circles.",
            "Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that time a great deal happened. Totski\u2019s position was very uncomfortable; having \u201cfunked\u201d once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply _afraid_ of Nastasia Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side. But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. He could not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.",
            "Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists, even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever.",
            "She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among these people she was much beloved.",
            "She received four or five friends sometimes, of an evening. Totski often came. Lately, too, General Epanchin had been enabled with great difficulty to introduce himself into her circle. Gania made her acquaintance also, and others were Ferdishenko, an ill-bred, and would-be witty, young clerk, and Ptitsin, a money-lender of modest and polished manners, who had risen from poverty. In fact, Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s beauty became a thing known to all the town; but not a single man could boast of anything more than his own admiration for her; and this reputation of hers, and her wit and culture and grace, all confirmed Totski in the plan he had now prepared.",
            "And it was at this moment that General Epanchin began to play so large and important a part in the story.",
            "When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full and candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her; words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort. So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasia\u2019s house one day, with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.",
            "General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of Totski\u2019s destiny at this moment. He then pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now hung upon her reply.",
            "To Nastasia\u2019s question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family, namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted, and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately, and would give his life for some response from her. The young fellow had confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Gania\u2019s love for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present life. Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything, but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably.",
            "Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down Totski\u2019s back to this very day; but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.",
            "First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question. She said that she had long since changed her views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still feel alarmed.",
            "She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.",
            "It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged her thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much. She thought it must be the case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What she specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.",
            "She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but\u2014another question!\u2014would they like to receive her into their house? At all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.",
            "She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself. She did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be known. She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and Totski during the last five years. If she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for her ruined life.",
            "She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten Totski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object (namely, Gania\u2019s attractiveness for Nastasia Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility of success.",
            "Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over. Very little was said\u2014her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question. But she recognized his love, on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right to say \u201cno\u201d up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment.",
            "It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. She said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.",
            "There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski\u2019s equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them; merely mentioning an instance or two. One was that Nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls\u2014a most unlikely rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.",
            "In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under the stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would \u201ctake it out of her,\u201d after marriage.",
            "Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.",
            "However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time.",
            "A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. What he thought to gain by Gania\u2019s marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania\u2019s complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia\u2019s birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband\u2019s infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place\u2014which fact alarmed him much.",
            "This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family. Before the prince\u2019s arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and \u201ccut\u201d the meal; which simply meant running away.",
            "He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed\u2014especially the evening\u2014without unpleasantness between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up\u2014\u201cas though Heaven had sent him on purpose,\u201d said the general to himself, as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom. "

            "Mrs. Epanchin was in the habit of holding herself very straight, and staring before her, without speaking, in moments of excitement.",
            "She was a fine woman of the same age as her husband, with a slightly hooked nose, a high, narrow forehead, thick hair turning a little grey, and a sallow complexion. Her eyes were grey and wore a very curious expression at times. She believed them to be most effective\u2014a belief that nothing could alter.",
            "\u201cWhat, receive him! Now, at once?\u201d asked Mrs. Epanchin, gazing vaguely at her husband as he stood fidgeting before her.",
            "\u201cOh, dear me, I assure you there is no need to stand on ceremony with him,\u201d the general explained hastily. \u201cHe is quite a child, not to say a pathetic-looking creature. He has fits of some sort, and has just arrived from Switzerland, straight from the station, dressed like a German and without a farthing in his pocket. I gave him twenty-five roubles to go on with, and am going to find him some easy place in one of the government offices. I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears, for I should think he must be very hungry.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou astonish me,\u201d said the lady, gazing as before. \u201cFits, and hungry too! What sort of fits?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, they don\u2019t come on frequently, besides, he\u2019s a regular child, though he seems to be fairly educated. I should like you, if possible, my dears,\u201d the general added, making slowly for the door, \u201cto put him through his paces a bit, and see what he is good for. I think you should be kind to him; it is a good deed, you know\u2014however, just as you like, of course\u2014but he is a sort of relation, remember, and I thought it might interest you to see the young fellow, seeing that this is so.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, of course, mamma, if we needn\u2019t stand on ceremony with him, we must give the poor fellow something to eat after his journey; especially as he has not the least idea where to go to,\u201d said Alexandra, the eldest of the girls.",
            "\u201cBesides, he\u2019s quite a child; we can entertain him with a little hide-and-seek, in case of need,\u201d said Adelaida.",
            "\u201cHide-and-seek? What do you mean?\u201d inquired Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "\u201cOh, do stop pretending, mamma,\u201d cried Aglaya, in vexation. \u201cSend him up, father; mother allows.\u201d",
            "The general rang the bell and gave orders that the prince should be shown in.",
            "\u201cOnly on condition that he has a napkin under his chin at lunch, then,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, \u201cand let Fedor, or Mavra, stand behind him while he eats. Is he quiet when he has these fits? He doesn\u2019t show violence, does he?\u201d",
            "\u201cOn the contrary, he seems to be very well brought up. His manners are excellent\u2014but here he is himself. Here you are, prince\u2014let me introduce you, the last of the Muishkins, a relative of your own, my dear, or at least of the same name. Receive him kindly, please. They\u2019ll bring in lunch directly, prince; you must stop and have some, but you must excuse me. I\u2019m in a hurry, I must be off\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWe all know where _you_ must be off to!\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, in a meaning voice.",

            "\u201cMamma!\u201d said Alexandra, shocked at her rudeness.",
            "Aglaya stamped her foot.",
            "\u201cNonsense! Let me alone!\u201d said the angry mother. \u201cNow then, prince, sit down here, no, nearer, come nearer the light! I want to have a good look at you. So, now then, who is this abbot?\u201d",
            "\u201cAbbot Pafnute,\u201d said our friend, seriously and with deference.",
            "\u201cPafnute, yes. And who was he?\u201d",
            "Mrs. Epanchin put these questions hastily and brusquely, and when the prince answered she nodded her head sagely at each word he said.",
            "\u201cThe Abbot Pafnute lived in the fourteenth century,\u201d began the prince; \u201che was in charge of one of the monasteries on the Volga, about where our present Kostroma government lies. He went to Oreol and helped in the great matters then going on in the religious world; he signed an edict there, and I have seen a print of his signature; it struck me, so I copied it. When the general asked me, in his study, to write something for him, to show my handwriting, I wrote \u2018The Abbot Pafnute signed this,\u2019 in the exact handwriting of the abbot. The general liked it very much, and that\u2019s why he recalled it just now.\u201d",
            "\u201cAglaya, make a note of \u2018Pafnute,\u2019 or we shall forget him. H\u2019m! and where is this signature?\u201d",

            "\u201cYes; come along, prince,\u201d said the mother, \u201care you very hungry?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes; I must say that I am pretty hungry, thanks very much.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! I like to see that you know your manners; and you are by no means such a person as the general thought fit to describe you. Come along; you sit here, opposite to me,\u201d she continued, \u201cI wish to be able to see your face. Alexandra, Adelaida, look after the prince! He doesn\u2019t seem so very ill, does he? I don\u2019t think he requires a napkin under his chin, after all; are you accustomed to having one on, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cFormerly, when I was seven years old or so. I believe I wore one; but now I usually hold my napkin on my knee when I eat.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course, of course! And about your fits?\u201d",
            "\u201cFits?\u201d asked the prince, slightly surprised. \u201cI very seldom have fits nowadays. I don\u2019t know how it may be here, though; they say the climate may be bad for me.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe talks very well, you know!\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, who still continued to nod at each word the prince spoke. \u201cI really did not expect it at all; in fact, I suppose it was all stuff and nonsense on the general\u2019s part, as usual. Eat away, prince, and tell me where you were born, and where you were brought up. I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!\u201d",
            "The prince expressed his thanks once more, and eating heartily the while, recommenced the narrative of his life in Switzerland, all of which we have heard before. Mrs. Epanchin became more and more pleased with her guest; the girls, too, listened with considerable attention. In talking over the question of relationship it turned out that the prince was very well up in the matter and knew his pedigree off by heart. It was found that scarcely any connection existed between himself and Mrs. Epanchin, but the talk, and the opportunity of conversing about her family tree, gratified the latter exceedingly, and she rose from the table in great good humour.",
            "\u201cLet\u2019s all go to my boudoir,\u201d she said, \u201cand they shall bring some coffee in there. That\u2019s the room where we all assemble and busy ourselves as we like best,\u201d she explained. \u201cAlexandra, my eldest, here, plays the piano, or reads or sews; Adelaida paints landscapes and portraits (but never finishes any); and Aglaya sits and does nothing. I don\u2019t work too much, either. Here we are, now; sit down, prince, near the fire and talk to us. I want to hear you relate something. I wish to make sure of you first and then tell my old friend, Princess Bielokonski, about you. I wish you to know all the good people and to interest them. Now then, begin!\u201d",
            "\u201cMamma, it\u2019s rather a strange order, that!\u201d said Adelaida, who was fussing among her paints and paint-brushes at the easel. Aglaya and Alexandra had settled themselves with folded hands on a sofa, evidently meaning to be listeners. The prince felt that the general attention was concentrated upon himself.",
            "\u201cI should refuse to say a word if _I_ were ordered to tell a story like that!\u201d observed Aglaya.",
            "\u201cWhy? what\u2019s there strange about it? He has a tongue. Why shouldn\u2019t he tell us something? I want to judge whether he is a good story-teller; anything you like, prince\u2014how you liked Switzerland, what was your first impression, anything. You\u2019ll see, he\u2019ll begin directly and tell us all about it beautifully.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe impression was forcible\u2014\u201d the prince began.",
            "\u201cThere, you see, girls,\u201d said the impatient lady, \u201che _has_ begun, you see.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, then, _let_ him talk, mamma,\u201d said Alexandra. \u201cThis prince is a great humbug and by no means an idiot,\u201d she whispered to Aglaya.",
            "\u201cOh, I saw that at once,\u201d replied the latter. \u201cI don\u2019t think it at all nice of him to play a part. What does he wish to gain by it, I wonder?\u201d",
            "\u201cMy first impression was a very strong one,\u201d repeated the prince. \u201cWhen they took me away from Russia, I remember I passed through many German towns and looked out of the windows, but did not trouble so much as to ask questions about them. This was after a long series of fits. I always used to fall into a sort of torpid condition after such a series, and lost my memory almost entirely; and though I was not altogether without reason at such times, yet I had no logical power of thought. This would continue for three or four days, and then I would recover myself again. I remember my melancholy was intolerable; I felt inclined to cry; I sat and wondered and wondered uncomfortably; the consciousness that everything was strange weighed terribly upon me; I could understand that it was all foreign and strange. I recollect I awoke from this state for the first time at Basle, one evening; the bray of a donkey aroused me, a donkey in the town market. I saw the donkey and was extremely pleased with it, and from that moment my head seemed to clear.\u201d",
            "\u201cA donkey? How strange! Yet it is not strange. Anyone of us might fall in love with a donkey! It happened in mythological times,\u201d said Madame Epanchin, looking wrathfully at her daughters, who had begun to laugh. \u201cGo on, prince.\u201d",
            "\u201cSince that evening I have been specially fond of donkeys. I began to ask questions about them, for I had never seen one before; and I at once came to the conclusion that this must be one of the most useful of animals\u2014strong, willing, patient, cheap; and, thanks to this donkey, I began to like the whole country I was travelling through; and my melancholy passed away.\u201d",
            "\u201cAll this is very strange and interesting,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin. \u201cNow let\u2019s leave the donkey and go on to other matters. What are you laughing at, Aglaya? and you too, Adelaida? The prince told us his experiences very cleverly; he saw the donkey himself, and what have you ever seen? _You_ have never been abroad.\u201d",
            "\u201cI have seen a donkey though, mamma!\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cAnd I\u2019ve heard one!\u201d said Adelaida. All three of the girls laughed out loud, and the prince laughed with them.",
            "\u201cWell, it\u2019s too bad of you,\u201d said mamma. \u201cYou must forgive them, prince; they are good girls. I am very fond of them, though I often have to be scolding them; they are all as silly and mad as march hares.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, why shouldn\u2019t they laugh?\u201d said the prince. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have let the chance go by in their place, I know. But I stick up for the donkey, all the same; he\u2019s a patient, good-natured fellow.\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you a patient man, prince? I ask out of curiosity,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "All laughed again.",
            "\u201cOh, that wretched donkey again, I see!\u201d cried the lady. \u201cI assure you, prince, I was not guilty of the least\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cInsinuation? Oh! I assure you, I take your word for it.\u201d And the prince continued laughing merrily.",
            "\u201cI must say it\u2019s very nice of you to laugh. I see you really are a kind-hearted fellow,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "\u201cI\u2019m not always kind, though.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am kind myself, and _always_ kind too, if you please!\u201d she retorted, unexpectedly; \u201cand that is my chief fault, for one ought not to be always kind. I am often angry with these girls and their father; but the worst of it is, I am always kindest when I am cross. I was very angry just before you came, and Aglaya there read me a lesson\u2014thanks, Aglaya, dear\u2014come and kiss me\u2014there\u2014that\u2019s enough\u201d she added, as Aglaya came forward and kissed her lips and then her hand. \u201cNow then, go on, prince. Perhaps you can think of something more exciting than about the donkey, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI must say, again, _I_ can\u2019t understand how you can expect anyone to tell you stories straight away, so,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cI know I never could!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, but the prince can, because he is clever\u2014cleverer than you are by ten or twenty times, if you like. There, that\u2019s so, prince; and seriously, let\u2019s drop the donkey now\u2014what else did you see abroad, besides the donkey?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, but the prince told us about the donkey very cleverly, all the same,\u201d said Alexandra. \u201cI have always been most interested to hear how people go mad and get well again, and that sort of thing. Especially when it happens suddenly.\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so, quite so!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, delighted. \u201cI see you _can_ be sensible now and then, Alexandra. You were speaking of Switzerland, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes. We came to Lucerne, and I was taken out in a boat. I felt how lovely it was, but the loveliness weighed upon me somehow or other, and made me feel melancholy.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Alexandra.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know; I always feel like that when I look at the beauties of nature for the first time; but then, I was ill at that time, of course!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I should like to see it!\u201d said Adelaida; \u201cand I don\u2019t know _when_ we shall ever go abroad. I\u2019ve been two years looking out for a good subject for a picture. I\u2019ve done all I know. \u2018The North and South I know by heart,\u2019 as our poet observes. Do help me to a subject, prince.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I know nothing about painting. It seems to me one only has to look, and paint what one sees.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I don\u2019t know _how_ to see!\u201d",
            "\u201cNonsense, what rubbish you talk!\u201d the mother struck in. \u201cNot know how to see! Open your eyes and look! If you can\u2019t see here, you won\u2019t see abroad either. Tell us what you saw yourself, prince!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, that\u2019s better,\u201d said Adelaida; \u201cthe prince _learned to see_ abroad.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I hardly know! You see, I only went to restore my health. I don\u2019t know whether I learned to see, exactly. I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.\u201d",
            "\u201cHappy! you can be happy?\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cThen how can you say you did not learn to see? I should think you could teach _us_ to see!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! _do_ teach us,\u201d laughed Adelaida.",
            "\u201cOh! I can\u2019t do that,\u201d said the prince, laughing too. \u201cI lived almost all the while in one little Swiss village; what can I teach you? At first I was only just not absolutely dull; then my health began to improve\u2014then every day became dearer and more precious to me, and the longer I stayed, the dearer became the time to me; so much so that I could not help observing it; but why this was so, it would be difficult to say.\u201d",
            "\u201cSo that you didn\u2019t care to go away anywhere else?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, at first I did; I was restless; I didn\u2019t know however I should manage to support life\u2014you know there are such moments, especially in solitude. There was a waterfall near us, such a lovely thin streak of water, like a thread but white and moving. It fell from a great height, but it looked quite low, and it was half a mile away, though it did not seem fifty paces. I loved to listen to it at night, but it was then that I became so restless. Sometimes I went and climbed the mountain and stood there in the midst of the tall pines, all alone in the terrible silence, with our little village in the distance, and the sky so blue, and the sun so bright, and an old ruined castle on the mountain-side, far away. I used to watch the line where earth and sky met, and longed to go and seek there the key of all mysteries, thinking that I might find there a new life, perhaps some great city where life should be grander and richer\u2014and then it struck me that life may be grand enough even in a prison.\u201d",
            "\u201cI read that last most praiseworthy thought in my manual, when I was twelve years old,\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cAll this is pure philosophy,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cYou are a philosopher, prince, and have come here to instruct us in your views.\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps you are right,\u201d said the prince, smiling. \u201cI think I am a philosopher, perhaps, and who knows, perhaps I do wish to teach my views of things to those I meet with?\u201d",
            "\u201cYour philosophy is rather like that of an old woman we know, who is rich and yet does nothing but try how little she can spend. She talks of nothing but money all day. Your great philosophical idea of a grand life in a prison and your four happy years in that Swiss village are like this, rather,\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cAs to life in a prison, of course there may be two opinions,\u201d said the prince. \u201cI once heard the story of a man who lived twelve years in a prison\u2014I heard it from the man himself. He was one of the persons under treatment with my professor; he had fits, and attacks of melancholy, then he would weep, and once he tried to commit suicide. _His_ life in prison was sad enough; his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating\u2014but I think I had better tell you of another man I met last year. There was a very strange feature in this case, strange because of its extremely rare occurrence. This man had once been brought to the scaffold in company with several others, and had had the sentence of death by shooting passed upon him for some political crime. Twenty minutes later he had been reprieved and some other punishment substituted; but the interval between the two sentences, twenty minutes, or at least a quarter of an hour, had been passed in the certainty that within a few minutes he must die. I was very anxious to hear him speak of his impressions during that dreadful time, and I several times inquired of him as to what he thought and felt. He remembered everything with the most accurate and extraordinary distinctness, and declared that he would never forget a single iota of the experience.",
            "\u201cAbout twenty paces from the scaffold, where he had stood to hear the sentence, were three posts, fixed in the ground, to which to fasten the criminals (of whom there were several). The first three criminals were taken to the posts, dressed in long white tunics, with white caps drawn over their faces, so that they could not see the rifles pointed at them. Then a group of soldiers took their stand opposite to each post. My friend was the eighth on the list, and therefore he would have been among the third lot to go up. A priest went about among them with a cross: and there was about five minutes of time left for him to live.",
            "\u201cHe said that those five minutes seemed to him to be a most interminable period, an enormous wealth of time; he seemed to be living, in these minutes, so many lives that there was no need as yet to think of that last moment, so that he made several arrangements, dividing up the time into portions\u2014one for saying farewell to his companions, two minutes for that; then a couple more for thinking over his own life and career and all about himself; and another minute for a last look around. He remembered having divided his time like this quite well. While saying good-bye to his friends he recollected asking one of them some very usual everyday question, and being much interested in the answer. Then having bade farewell, he embarked upon those two minutes which he had allotted to looking into himself; he knew beforehand what he was going to think about. He wished to put it to himself as quickly and clearly as possible, that here was he, a living, thinking man, and that in three minutes he would be nobody; or if somebody or something, then what and where? He thought he would decide this question once for all in these last three minutes. A little way off there stood a church, and its gilded spire glittered in the sun. He remembered staring stubbornly at this spire, and at the rays of light sparkling from it. He could not tear his eyes from these rays of light; he got the idea that these rays were his new nature, and that in three minutes he would become one of them, amalgamated somehow with them.",
            "\u201cThe repugnance to what must ensue almost immediately, and the uncertainty, were dreadful, he said; but worst of all was the idea, \u2018What should I do if I were not to die now? What if I were to return to life again? What an eternity of days, and all mine! How I should grudge and count up every minute of it, so as to waste not a single instant!\u2019 He said that this thought weighed so upon him and became such a terrible burden upon his brain that he could not bear it, and wished they would shoot him quickly and have done with it.\u201d",
            "The prince paused and all waited, expecting him to go on again and finish the story.",
            "\u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Aglaya.",
            "\u201cAll? Yes,\u201d said the prince, emerging from a momentary reverie.",
            "\u201cAnd why did you tell us this?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I happened to recall it, that\u2019s all! It fitted into the conversation\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYou probably wish to deduce, prince,\u201d said Alexandra, \u201cthat moments of time cannot be reckoned by money value, and that sometimes five minutes are worth priceless treasures. All this is very praiseworthy; but may I ask about this friend of yours, who told you the terrible experience of his life? He was reprieved, you say; in other words, they did restore to him that \u2018eternity of days.\u2019 What did he do with these riches of time? Did he keep careful account of his minutes?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no, he didn\u2019t! I asked him myself. He said that he had not lived a bit as he had intended, and had wasted many, and many a minute.\u201d",
            "\u201cVery well, then there\u2019s an experiment, and the thing is proved; one cannot live and count each moment; say what you like, but one _cannot_.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is true,\u201d said the prince, \u201cI have thought so myself. And yet, why shouldn\u2019t one do it?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou think, then, that you could live more wisely than other people?\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cI have had that idea.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you have it still?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I have it still,\u201d the prince replied.",
            "He had contemplated Aglaya until now, with a pleasant though rather timid smile, but as the last words fell from his lips he began to laugh, and looked at her merrily.",
            "\u201cYou are not very modest!\u201d said she.",
            "\u201cBut how brave you are!\u201d said he. \u201cYou are laughing, and I\u2014that man\u2019s tale impressed me so much, that I dreamt of it afterwards; yes, I dreamt of those five minutes...\u201d",
            "He looked at his listeners again with that same serious, searching expression.",
            "\u201cYou are not angry with me?\u201d he asked suddenly, and with a kind of nervous hurry, although he looked them straight in the face.",
            "\u201cWhy should we be angry?\u201d they cried.",
            "\u201cOnly because I seem to be giving you a lecture, all the time!\u201d",
            "At this they laughed heartily.",
            "\u201cPlease don\u2019t be angry with me,\u201d continued the prince. \u201cI know very well that I have seen less of life than other people, and have less knowledge of it. I must appear to speak strangely sometimes...\u201d",
            "He said the last words nervously.",
            "\u201cYou say you have been happy, and that proves you have lived, not less, but more than other people. Why make all these excuses?\u201d interrupted Aglaya in a mocking tone of voice. \u201cBesides, you need not mind about lecturing us; you have nothing to boast of. With your quietism, one could live happily for a hundred years at least. One might show you the execution of a felon, or show you one\u2019s little finger. You could draw a moral from either, and be quite satisfied. That sort of existence is easy enough.\u201d",
            "\u201cI can\u2019t understand why you always fly into a temper,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, who had been listening to the conversation and examining the faces of the speakers in turn. \u201cI do not understand what you mean. What has your little finger to do with it? The prince talks well, though he is not amusing. He began all right, but now he seems sad.\u201d",
            "\u201cNever mind, mamma! Prince, I wish you had seen an execution,\u201d said Aglaya. \u201cI should like to ask you a question about that, if you had.\u201d",
            "\u201cI have seen an execution,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cYou have!\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cI might have guessed it. That\u2019s a fitting crown to the rest of the story. If you have seen an execution, how can you say you lived happily all the while?\u201d",
            "\u201cBut is there capital punishment where you were?\u201d asked Adelaida.",
            "\u201cI saw it at Lyons. Schneider took us there, and as soon as we arrived we came in for that.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, and did you like it very much? Was it very edifying and instructive?\u201d asked Aglaya.",
            "\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t like it at all, and was ill after seeing it; but I confess I stared as though my eyes were fixed to the sight. I could not tear them away.\u201d",
            "\u201cI, too, should have been unable to tear my eyes away,\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cThey do not at all approve of women going to see an execution there. The women who do go are condemned for it afterwards in the newspapers.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is, by contending that it is not a sight for women they admit that it is a sight for men. I congratulate them on the deduction. I suppose you quite agree with them, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cTell us about the execution,\u201d put in Adelaida.",
            "\u201cI would much rather not, just now,\u201d said the prince, a little disturbed and frowning slightly.",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to want to tell us,\u201d said Aglaya, with a mocking air.",
            "\u201cNo,\u2014the thing is, I was telling all about the execution a little while ago, and\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhom did you tell about it?\u201d",
            "\u201cThe man-servant, while I was waiting to see the general.\u201d",
            "\u201cOur man-servant?\u201d exclaimed several voices at once.",
            "\u201cYes, the one who waits in the entrance hall, a greyish, red-faced man\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cThe prince is clearly a democrat,\u201d remarked Aglaya.",
            "\u201cWell, if you could tell Aleksey about it, surely you can tell us too.\u201d",
            "\u201cI do so want to hear about it,\u201d repeated Adelaida.",
            "\u201cJust now, I confess,\u201d began the prince, with more animation, \u201cwhen you asked me for a subject for a picture, I confess I had serious thoughts of giving you one. I thought of asking you to draw the face of a criminal, one minute before the fall of the guillotine, while the wretched man is still standing on the scaffold, preparatory to placing his neck on the block.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, his face? only his face?\u201d asked Adelaida. \u201cThat would be a strange subject indeed. And what sort of a picture would that make?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, why not?\u201d the prince insisted, with some warmth. \u201cWhen I was in Basle I saw a picture very much in that style\u2014I should like to tell you about it; I will some time or other; it struck me very forcibly.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, you shall tell us about the Basle picture another time; now we must have all about the execution,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cTell us about that face as it appeared to your imagination\u2014how should it be drawn?\u2014just the face alone, do you mean?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt was just a minute before the execution,\u201d began the prince, readily, carried away by the recollection and evidently forgetting everything else in a moment; \u201cjust at the instant when he stepped off the ladder on to the scaffold. He happened to look in my direction: I saw his eyes and understood all, at once\u2014but how am I to describe it? I do so wish you or somebody else could draw it, you, if possible. I thought at the time what a picture it would make. You must imagine all that went before, of course, all\u2014all. He had lived in the prison for some time and had not expected that the execution would take place for at least a week yet\u2014he had counted on all the formalities and so on taking time; but it so happened that his papers had been got ready quickly. At five o\u2019clock in the morning he was asleep\u2014it was October, and at five in the morning it was cold and dark. The governor of the prison comes in on tip-toe and touches the sleeping man\u2019s shoulder gently. He starts up. \u2018What is it?\u2019 he says. \u2018The execution is fixed for ten o\u2019clock.\u2019 He was only just awake, and would not believe at first, but began to argue that his papers would not be out for a week, and so on. When he was wide awake and realized the truth, he became very silent and argued no more\u2014so they say; but after a bit he said: \u2018It comes very hard on one so suddenly\u2019 and then he was silent again and said nothing.",
            "\u201cThe three or four hours went by, of course, in necessary preparations\u2014the priest, breakfast, (coffee, meat, and some wine they gave him; doesn\u2019t it seem ridiculous?) And yet I believe these people give them a good breakfast out of pure kindness of heart, and believe that they are doing a good action. Then he is dressed, and then begins the procession through the town to the scaffold. I think he, too, must feel that he has an age to live still while they cart him along. Probably he thought, on the way, \u2018Oh, I have a long, long time yet. Three streets of life yet! When we\u2019ve passed this street there\u2019ll be that other one; and then that one where the baker\u2019s shop is on the right; and when shall we get there? It\u2019s ages, ages!\u2019 Around him are crowds shouting, yelling\u2014ten thousand faces, twenty thousand eyes. All this has to be endured, and especially the thought: \u2018Here are ten thousand men, and not one of them is going to be executed, and yet I am to die.\u2019 Well, all that is preparatory.",
            "\u201cAt the scaffold there is a ladder, and just there he burst into tears\u2014and this was a strong man, and a terribly wicked one, they say! There was a priest with him the whole time, talking; even in the cart as they drove along, he talked and talked. Probably the other heard nothing; he would begin to listen now and then, and at the third word or so he had forgotten all about it.",
            "\u201cAt last he began to mount the steps; his legs were tied, so that he had to take very small steps. The priest, who seemed to be a wise man, had stopped talking now, and only held the cross for the wretched fellow to kiss. At the foot of the ladder he had been pale enough; but when he set foot on the scaffold at the top, his face suddenly became the colour of paper, positively like white notepaper. His legs must have become suddenly feeble and helpless, and he felt a choking in his throat\u2014you know the sudden feeling one has in moments of terrible fear, when one does not lose one\u2019s wits, but is absolutely powerless to move? If some dreadful thing were suddenly to happen; if a house were just about to fall on one;\u2014don\u2019t you know how one would long to sit down and shut one\u2019s eyes and wait, and wait? Well, when this terrible feeling came over him, the priest quickly pressed the cross to his lips, without a word\u2014a little silver cross it was\u2014and he kept on pressing it to the man\u2019s lips every second. And whenever the cross touched his lips, the eyes would open for a moment, and the legs moved once, and he kissed the cross greedily, hurriedly\u2014just as though he were anxious to catch hold of something in case of its being useful to him afterwards, though he could hardly have had any connected religious thoughts at the time. And so up to the very block.",
            "\u201cHow strange that criminals seldom swoon at such a moment! On the contrary, the brain is especially active, and works incessantly\u2014probably hard, hard, hard\u2014like an engine at full pressure. I imagine that various thoughts must beat loud and fast through his head\u2014all unfinished ones, and strange, funny thoughts, very likely!\u2014like this, for instance: \u2018That man is looking at me, and he has a wart on his forehead! and the executioner has burst one of his buttons, and the lowest one is all rusty!\u2019 And meanwhile he notices and remembers everything. There is one point that cannot be forgotten, round which everything else dances and turns about; and because of this point he cannot faint, and this lasts until the very final quarter of a second, when the wretched neck is on the block and the victim listens and waits and _knows_\u2014that\u2019s the point, he _knows_ that he is just _now_ about to die, and listens for the rasp of the iron over his head. If I lay there, I should certainly listen for that grating sound, and hear it, too! There would probably be but the tenth part of an instant left to hear it in, but one would certainly hear it. And imagine, some people declare that when the head flies off it is _conscious_ of having flown off! Just imagine what a thing to realize! Fancy if consciousness were to last for even five seconds!",
            "\u201cDraw the scaffold so that only the top step of the ladder comes in clearly. The criminal must be just stepping on to it, his face as white as note-paper. The priest is holding the cross to his blue lips, and the criminal kisses it, and knows and sees and understands everything. The cross and the head\u2014there\u2019s your picture; the priest and the executioner, with his two assistants, and a few heads and eyes below. Those might come in as subordinate accessories\u2014a sort of mist. There\u2019s a picture for you.\u201d The prince paused, and looked around.",

            "\u201cWell, then\u2014they were all children there, and I was always among children and only with children. They were the children of the village in which I lived, and they went to the school there\u2014all of them. I did not teach them, oh no; there was a master for that, one Jules Thibaut. I may have taught them some things, but I was among them just as an outsider, and I passed all four years of my life there among them. I wished for nothing better; I used to tell them everything and hid nothing from them. Their fathers and relations were very angry with me, because the children could do nothing without me at last, and used to throng after me at all times. The schoolmaster was my greatest enemy in the end! I had many enemies, and all because of the children. Even Schneider reproached me. What were they afraid of? One can tell a child everything, anything. I have often been struck by the fact that parents know their children so little. They should not conceal so much from them. How well even little children understand that their parents conceal things from them, because they consider them too young to understand! Children are capable of giving advice in the most important matters. How can one deceive these dear little birds, when they look at one so sweetly and confidingly? I call them birds because there is nothing in the world better than birds!",
            "\u201cHowever, most of the people were angry with me about one and the same thing; but Thibaut simply was jealous of me. At first he had wagged his head and wondered how it was that the children understood what I told them so well, and could not learn from him; and he laughed like anything when I replied that neither he nor I could teach them very much, but that _they_ might teach us a good deal.",
            "\u201cHow he could hate me and tell scandalous stories about me, living among children as he did, is what I cannot understand. Children soothe and heal the wounded heart. I remember there was one poor fellow at our professor\u2019s who was being treated for madness, and you have no idea what those children did for him, eventually. I don\u2019t think he was mad, but only terribly unhappy. But I\u2019ll tell you all about him another day. Now I must get on with this story.",
            "\u201cThe children did not love me at first; I was such a sickly, awkward kind of a fellow then\u2014and I know I am ugly. Besides, I was a foreigner. The children used to laugh at me, at first; and they even went so far as to throw stones at me, when they saw me kiss Marie. I only kissed her once in my life\u2014no, no, don\u2019t laugh!\u201d The prince hastened to suppress the smiles of his audience at this point. \u201cIt was not a matter of _love_ at all! If only you knew what a miserable creature she was, you would have pitied her, just as I did. She belonged to our village. Her mother was an old, old woman, and they used to sell string and thread, and soap and tobacco, out of the window of their little house, and lived on the pittance they gained by this trade. The old woman was ill and very old, and could hardly move. Marie was her daughter, a girl of twenty, weak and thin and consumptive; but still she did heavy work at the houses around, day by day. Well, one fine day a commercial traveller betrayed her and carried her off; and a week later he deserted her. She came home dirty, draggled, and shoeless; she had walked for a whole week without shoes; she had slept in the fields, and caught a terrible cold; her feet were swollen and sore, and her hands torn and scratched all over. She never had been pretty even before; but her eyes were quiet, innocent, kind eyes.",
            "\u201cShe was very quiet always\u2014and I remember once, when she had suddenly begun singing at her work, everyone said, \u2018Marie tried to sing today!\u2019 and she got so chaffed that she was silent for ever after. She had been treated kindly in the place before; but when she came back now\u2014ill and shunned and miserable\u2014not one of them all had the slightest sympathy for her. Cruel people! Oh, what hazy understandings they have on such matters! Her mother was the first to show the way. She received her wrathfully, unkindly, and with contempt. \u2018You have disgraced me,\u2019 she said. She was the first to cast her into ignominy; but when they all heard that Marie had returned to the village, they ran out to see her and crowded into the little cottage\u2014old men, children, women, girls\u2014such a hurrying, stamping, greedy crowd. Marie was lying on the floor at the old woman\u2019s feet, hungry, torn, draggled, crying, miserable.",
            "\u201cWhen everyone crowded into the room she hid her face in her dishevelled hair and lay cowering on the floor. Everyone looked at her as though she were a piece of dirt off the road. The old men scolded and condemned, and the young ones laughed at her. The women condemned her too, and looked at her contemptuously, just as though she were some loathsome insect.",
            "\u201cHer mother allowed all this to go on, and nodded her head and encouraged them. The old woman was very ill at that time, and knew she was dying (she really did die a couple of months later), and though she felt the end approaching she never thought of forgiving her daughter, to the very day of her death. She would not even speak to her. She made her sleep on straw in a shed, and hardly gave her food enough to support life.",
            "\u201cMarie was very gentle to her mother, and nursed her, and did everything for her; but the old woman accepted all her services without a word and never showed her the slightest kindness. Marie bore all this; and I could see when I got to know her that she thought it quite right and fitting, considering herself the lowest and meanest of creatures.",
            "\u201cWhen the old woman took to her bed finally, the other old women in the village sat with her by turns, as the custom is there; and then Marie was quite driven out of the house. They gave her no food at all, and she could not get any work in the village; none would employ her. The men seemed to consider her no longer a woman, they said such dreadful things to her. Sometimes on Sundays, if they were drunk enough, they used to throw her a penny or two, into the mud, and Marie would silently pick up the money. She had began to spit blood at that time.",
            "\u201cAt last her rags became so tattered and torn that she was ashamed of appearing in the village any longer. The children used to pelt her with mud; so she begged to be taken on as assistant cowherd, but the cowherd would not have her. Then she took to helping him without leave; and he saw how valuable her assistance was to him, and did not drive her away again; on the contrary, he occasionally gave her the remnants of his dinner, bread and cheese. He considered that he was being very kind. When the mother died, the village parson was not ashamed to hold Marie up to public derision and shame. Marie was standing at the coffin\u2019s head, in all her rags, crying.",
            "\u201cA crowd of people had collected to see how she would cry. The parson, a young fellow ambitious of becoming a great preacher, began his sermon and pointed to Marie. \u2018There,\u2019 he said, \u2018there is the cause of the death of this venerable woman\u2019\u2014(which was a lie, because she had been ill for at least two years)\u2014\u2018there she stands before you, and dares not lift her eyes from the ground, because she knows that the finger of God is upon her. Look at her tatters and rags\u2014the badge of those who lose their virtue. Who is she? her daughter!\u2019 and so on to the end.",
            "\u201cAnd just fancy, this infamy pleased them, all of them, nearly. Only the children had altered\u2014for then they were all on my side and had learned to love Marie.",
            "\u201cThis is how it was: I had wished to do something for Marie; I longed to give her some money, but I never had a farthing while I was there. But I had a little diamond pin, and this I sold to a travelling pedlar; he gave me eight francs for it\u2014it was worth at least forty.",
            "\u201cI long sought to meet Marie alone; and at last I did meet her, on the hillside beyond the village. I gave her the eight francs and asked her to take care of the money because I could get no more; and then I kissed her and said that she was not to suppose I kissed her with any evil motives or because I was in love with her, for that I did so solely out of pity for her, and because from the first I had not accounted her as guilty so much as unfortunate. I longed to console and encourage her somehow, and to assure her that she was not the low, base thing which she and others strove to make out; but I don\u2019t think she understood me. She stood before me, dreadfully ashamed of herself, and with downcast eyes; and when I had finished she kissed my hand. I would have kissed hers, but she drew it away. Just at this moment the whole troop of children saw us. (I found out afterwards that they had long kept a watch upon me.) They all began whistling and clapping their hands, and laughing at us. Marie ran away at once; and when I tried to talk to them, they threw stones at me. All the village heard of it the same day, and Marie\u2019s position became worse than ever. The children would not let her pass now in the streets, but annoyed her and threw dirt at her more than before. They used to run after her\u2014she racing away with her poor feeble lungs panting and gasping, and they pelting her and shouting abuse at her.",
            "\u201cOnce I had to interfere by force; and after that I took to speaking to them every day and whenever I could. Occasionally they stopped and listened; but they teased Marie all the same.",
            "\u201cI told them how unhappy Marie was, and after a while they stopped their abuse of her, and let her go by silently. Little by little we got into the way of conversing together, the children and I. I concealed nothing from them, I told them all. They listened very attentively and soon began to be sorry for Marie. At last some of them took to saying \u2018Good-morning\u2019 to her, kindly, when they met her. It is the custom there to salute anyone you meet with \u2018Good-morning\u2019 whether acquainted or not. I can imagine how astonished Marie was at these first greetings from the children.",
            "\u201cOnce two little girls got hold of some food and took it to her, and came back and told me. They said she had burst into tears, and that they loved her very much now. Very soon after that they all became fond of Marie, and at the same time they began to develop the greatest affection for myself. They often came to me and begged me to tell them stories. I think I must have told stories well, for they did so love to hear them. At last I took to reading up interesting things on purpose to pass them on to the little ones, and this went on for all the rest of my time there, three years. Later, when everyone\u2014even Schneider\u2014was angry with me for hiding nothing from the children, I pointed out how foolish it was, for they always knew things, only they learnt them in a way that soiled their minds but not so from me. One has only to remember one\u2019s own childhood to admit the truth of this. But nobody was convinced... It was two weeks before her mother died that I had kissed Marie; and when the clergyman preached that sermon the children were all on my side.",
            "\u201cWhen I told them what a shame it was of the parson to talk as he had done, and explained my reason, they were so angry that some of them went and broke his windows with stones. Of course I stopped them, for that was not right, but all the village heard of it, and how I caught it for spoiling the children! Everyone discovered now that the little ones had taken to being fond of Marie, and their parents were terribly alarmed; but Marie was so happy. The children were forbidden to meet her; but they used to run out of the village to the herd and take her food and things; and sometimes just ran off there and kissed her, and said, \u2018_Je vous aime, Marie!_\u2019 and then trotted back again. They imagined that I was in love with Marie, and this was the only point on which I did not undeceive them, for they got such enjoyment out of it. And what delicacy and tenderness they showed!",
            "\u201cIn the evening I used to walk to the waterfall. There was a spot there which was quite closed in and hidden from view by large trees; and to this spot the children used to come to me. They could not bear that their dear Leon should love a poor girl without shoes to her feet and dressed all in rags and tatters. So, would you believe it, they actually clubbed together, somehow, and bought her shoes and stockings, and some linen, and even a dress! I can\u2019t understand how they managed it, but they did it, all together. When I asked them about it they only laughed and shouted, and the little girls clapped their hands and kissed me. I sometimes went to see Marie secretly, too. She had become very ill, and could hardly walk. She still went with the herd, but could not help the herdsman any longer. She used to sit on a stone near, and wait there almost motionless all day, till the herd went home. Her consumption was so advanced, and she was so weak, that she used to sit with closed eyes, breathing heavily. Her face was as thin as a skeleton\u2019s, and sweat used to stand on her white brow in large drops. I always found her sitting just like that. I used to come up quietly to look at her; but Marie would hear me, open her eyes, and tremble violently as she kissed my hands. I did not take my hand away because it made her happy to have it, and so she would sit and cry quietly. Sometimes she tried to speak; but it was very difficult to understand her. She was almost like a madwoman, with excitement and ecstasy, whenever I came. Occasionally the children came with me; when they did so, they would stand some way off and keep guard over us, so as to tell me if anybody came near. This was a great pleasure to them.",
            "\u201cWhen we left her, Marie used to relapse at once into her old condition, and sit with closed eyes and motionless limbs. One day she could not go out at all, and remained at home all alone in the empty hut; but the children very soon became aware of the fact, and nearly all of them visited her that day as she lay alone and helpless in her miserable bed.",
            "\u201cFor two days the children looked after her, and then, when the village people got to know that Marie was really dying, some of the old women came and took it in turns to sit by her and look after her a bit. I think they began to be a little sorry for her in the village at last; at all events they did not interfere with the children any more, on her account.",
            "\u201cMarie lay in a state of uncomfortable delirium the whole while; she coughed dreadfully. The old women would not let the children stay in the room; but they all collected outside the window each morning, if only for a moment, and shouted \u2018_Bon jour, notre bonne Marie!_\u2019 and Marie no sooner caught sight of, or heard them, and she became quite animated at once, and, in spite of the old women, would try to sit up and nod her head and smile at them, and thank them. The little ones used to bring her nice things and sweets to eat, but she could hardly touch anything. Thanks to them, I assure you, the girl died almost perfectly happy. She almost forgot her misery, and seemed to accept their love as a sort of symbol of pardon for her offence, though she never ceased to consider herself a dreadful sinner. They used to flutter at her window just like little birds, calling out: \u2018_Nous t\u2019aimons, Marie!_\u2019",
            "\u201cShe died very soon; I had thought she would live much longer. The day before her death I went to see her for the last time, just before sunset. I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand.",
            "\u201cNext morning they came and told me that Marie was dead. The children could not be restrained now; they went and covered her coffin with flowers, and put a wreath of lovely blossoms on her head. The pastor did not throw any more shameful words at the poor dead woman; but there were very few people at the funeral. However, when it came to carrying the coffin, all the children rushed up, to carry it themselves. Of course they could not do it alone, but they insisted on helping, and walked alongside and behind, crying.",
            "\u201cThey have planted roses all round her grave, and every year they look after the flowers and make Marie\u2019s resting-place as beautiful as they can. I was in ill odour after all this with the parents of the children, and especially with the parson and schoolmaster. Schneider was obliged to promise that I should not meet them and talk to them; but we conversed from a distance by signs, and they used to write me sweet little notes. Afterwards I came closer than ever to those little souls, but even then it was very dear to me, to have them so fond of me.",
            "\u201cSchneider said that I did the children great harm by my pernicious \u2018system\u2019; what nonsense that was! And what did he mean by my system? He said afterwards that he believed I was a child myself\u2014just before I came away. \u2018You have the form and face of an adult\u2019 he said, \u2018but as regards soul, and character, and perhaps even intelligence, you are a child in the completest sense of the word, and always will be, if you live to be sixty.\u2019 I laughed very much, for of course that is nonsense. But it is a fact that I do not care to be among grown-up people and much prefer the society of children. However kind people may be to me, I never feel quite at home with them, and am always glad to get back to my little companions. Now my companions have always been children, not because I was a child myself once, but because young things attract me. On one of the first days of my stay in Switzerland, I was strolling about alone and miserable, when I came upon the children rushing noisily out of school, with their slates and bags, and books, their games, their laughter and shouts\u2014and my soul went out to them. I stopped and laughed happily as I watched their little feet moving so quickly. Girls and boys, laughing and crying; for as they went home many of them found time to fight and make peace, to weep and play. I forgot my troubles in looking at them. And then, all those three years, I tried to understand why men should be for ever tormenting themselves. I lived the life of a child there, and thought I should never leave the little village; indeed, I was far from thinking that I should ever return to Russia. But at last I recognized the fact that Schneider could not keep me any longer. And then something so important happened, that Schneider himself urged me to depart. I am going to see now if can get good advice about it. Perhaps my lot in life will be changed; but that is not the principal thing. The principal thing is the entire change that has already come over me. I left many things behind me\u2014too many. They have gone. On the journey I said to myself, \u2018I am going into the world of men. I don\u2019t know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for me.\u2019 I made up my mind to be honest, and steadfast in accomplishing my task. Perhaps I shall meet with troubles and many disappointments, but I have made up my mind to be polite and sincere to everyone; more cannot be asked of me. People may consider me a child if they like. I am often called an idiot, and at one time I certainly was so ill that I was nearly as bad as an idiot; but I am not an idiot now. How can I possibly be so when I know myself that I am considered one?",
            "\u201cWhen I received a letter from those dear little souls, while passing through Berlin, I only then realized how much I loved them. It was very, very painful, getting that first little letter. How melancholy they had been when they saw me off! For a month before, they had been talking of my departure and sorrowing over it; and at the waterfall, of an evening, when we parted for the night, they would hug me so tight and kiss me so warmly, far more so than before. And every now and then they would turn up one by one when I was alone, just to give me a kiss and a hug, to show their love for me. The whole flock went with me to the station, which was about a mile from the village, and every now and then one of them would stop to throw his arms round me, and all the little girls had tears in their voices, though they tried hard not to cry. As the train steamed out of the station, I saw them all standing on the platform waving to me and crying \u2018Hurrah!\u2019 till they were lost in the distance.",
            "\u201cI assure you, when I came in here just now and saw your kind faces (I can read faces well) my heart felt light for the first time since that moment of parting. I think I must be one of those who are born to be in luck, for one does not often meet with people whom one feels he can love from the first sight of their faces; and yet, no sooner do I step out of the railway carriage than I happen upon you!",
            "\u201cI know it is more or less a shamefaced thing to speak of one\u2019s feelings before others; and yet here am I talking like this to you, and am not a bit ashamed or shy. I am an unsociable sort of fellow and shall very likely not come to see you again for some time; but don\u2019t think the worse of me for that. It is not that I do not value your society; and you must never suppose that I have taken offence at anything.",

Not to speak of your natural beauty, one can look at your face and say to one\u2019s self, \u2018She has the face of a kind sister.\u2019 You are simple and merry, but you can see into another\u2019s heart very quickly. That\u2019s what I read in your face.",

Don\u2019t be angry with me for saying so; you know what my feelings for children are. And do not suppose that I am so candid out of pure simplicity of soul. Oh dear no, it is by no means the case!

            "\u201cHow stupid of me to speak of the portrait,\u201d thought the prince as he entered the study, with a feeling of guilt at his heart, \u201cand yet, perhaps I was right after all.\u201d He had an idea, unformed as yet, but a strange idea.",
            "Gavrila Ardalionovitch was still sitting in the study, buried in a mass of papers. He looked as though he did not take his salary from the public company, whose servant he was, for a sinecure.",
            "He grew very wroth and confused when the prince asked for the portrait, and explained how it came about that he had spoken of it.",
            "\u201cOh, curse it all,\u201d he said; \u201cwhat on earth must you go blabbing for? You know nothing about the thing, and yet\u2014idiot!\u201d he added, muttering the last word to himself in irrepressible rage.",
            "\u201cI am very sorry; I was not thinking at the time. I merely said that Aglaya was almost as beautiful as Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d",
            "Gania asked for further details; and the prince once more repeated the conversation. Gania looked at him with ironical contempt the while.",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna,\u201d he began, and there paused; he was clearly much agitated and annoyed. The prince reminded him of the portrait.",
            "\u201cListen, prince,\u201d said Gania, as though an idea had just struck him, \u201cI wish to ask you a great favour, and yet I really don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d",
            "He paused again, he was trying to make up his mind to something, and was turning the matter over. The prince waited quietly. Once more Gania fixed him with intent and questioning eyes.",
            "\u201cPrince,\u201d he began again, \u201cthey are rather angry with me, in there, owing to a circumstance which I need not explain, so that I do not care to go in at present without an invitation. I particularly wish to speak to Aglaya, but I have written a few words in case I shall not have the chance of seeing her\u201d (here the prince observed a small note in his hand), \u201cand I do not know how to get my communication to her. Don\u2019t you think you could undertake to give it to her at once, but only to her, mind, and so that no one else should see you give it? It isn\u2019t much of a secret, but still\u2014Well, will you do it?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t quite like it,\u201d replied the prince.",
            "\u201cOh, but it is absolutely necessary for me,\u201d Gania entreated. \u201cBelieve me, if it were not so, I would not ask you; how else am I to get it to her? It is most important, dreadfully important!\u201d",
            "Gania was evidently much alarmed at the idea that the prince would not consent to take his note, and he looked at him now with an expression of absolute entreaty.",
            "\u201cWell, I will take it then.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut mind, nobody is to see!\u201d cried the delighted Gania \u201cAnd of course I may rely on your word of honour, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI won\u2019t show it to anyone,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cThe letter is not sealed\u2014\u201d continued Gania, and paused in confusion.",
            "\u201cOh, I won\u2019t read it,\u201d said the prince, quite simply.",
            "He took up the portrait, and went out of the room.",
            "Gania, left alone, clutched his head with his hands.",
            "\u201cOne word from her,\u201d he said, \u201cone word from her, and I may yet be free.\u201d",
            "He could not settle himself to his papers again, for agitation and excitement, but began walking up and down the room from corner to corner.",
            "The prince walked along, musing. He did not like his commission, and disliked the idea of Gania sending a note to Aglaya at all; but when he was two rooms distant from the drawing-room, where they all were, he stopped as though recalling something; went to the window, nearer the light, and began to examine the portrait in his hand.",
            "He longed to solve the mystery of something in the face of Nastasia Philipovna, something which had struck him as he looked at the portrait for the first time; the impression had not left him. It was partly the fact of her marvellous beauty that struck him, and partly something else. There was a suggestion of immense pride and disdain in the face almost of hatred, and at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. The contrast aroused a deep sympathy in his heart as he looked at the lovely face. The blinding loveliness of it was almost intolerable, this pale thin face with its flaming eyes; it was a strange beauty.",
            "The prince gazed at it for a minute or two, then glanced around him, and hurriedly raised the portrait to his lips. When, a minute after, he reached the drawing-room door, his face was quite composed. But just as he reached the door he met Aglaya coming out alone.",
            "\u201cGavrila Ardalionovitch begged me to give you this,\u201d he said, handing her the note.",
            "Aglaya stopped, took the letter, and gazed strangely into the prince\u2019s eyes. There was no confusion in her face; a little surprise, perhaps, but that was all. By her look she seemed merely to challenge the prince to an explanation as to how he and Gania happened to be connected in this matter. But her expression was perfectly cool and quiet, and even condescending.",
            "So they stood for a moment or two, confronting one another. At length a faint smile passed over her face, and she passed by him without a word.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin examined the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna for some little while, holding it critically at arm\u2019s length.",
            "\u201cYes, she is pretty,\u201d she said at last, \u201ceven very pretty. I have seen her twice, but only at a distance. So you admire this kind of beauty, do you?\u201d she asked the prince, suddenly.",
            "\u201cYes, I do\u2014this kind.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you mean especially this kind?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, especially this kind.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy?\u201d",
            "\u201cThere is much suffering in this face,\u201d murmured the prince, more as though talking to himself than answering the question.",
            "\u201cI think you are wandering a little, prince,\u201d Mrs. Epanchin decided, after a lengthened survey of his face; and she tossed the portrait on to the table, haughtily.",
            "Alexandra took it, and Adelaida came up, and both the girls examined the photograph. Just then Aglaya entered the room.",
            "\u201cWhat a power!\u201d cried Adelaida suddenly, as she earnestly examined the portrait over her sister\u2019s shoulder.",
            "\u201cWhom? What power?\u201d asked her mother, crossly.",
            "\u201cSuch beauty is real power,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cWith such beauty as that one might overthrow the world.\u201d She returned to her easel thoughtfully.",
            "Aglaya merely glanced at the portrait\u2014frowned, and put out her underlip; then went and sat down on the sofa with folded hands. Mrs. Epanchin rang the bell.",
            "\u201cAsk Gavrila Ardalionovitch to step this way,\u201d said she to the man who answered.",
            "\u201cMamma!\u201d cried Alexandra, significantly.",
            "\u201cI shall just say two words to him, that\u2019s all,\u201d said her mother, silencing all objection by her manner; she was evidently seriously put out. \u201cYou see, prince, it is all secrets with us, just now\u2014all secrets. It seems to be the etiquette of the house, for some reason or other. Stupid nonsense, and in a matter which ought to be approached with all candour and open-heartedness. There is a marriage being talked of, and I don\u2019t like this marriage\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cMamma, what are you saying?\u201d said Alexandra again, hurriedly.",
            "\u201cWell, what, my dear girl? As if you can possibly like it yourself? The heart is the great thing, and the rest is all rubbish\u2014though one must have sense as well. Perhaps sense is really the great thing. Don\u2019t smile like that, Aglaya. I don\u2019t contradict myself. A fool with a heart and no brains is just as unhappy as a fool with brains and no heart. I am one and you are the other, and therefore both of us suffer, both of us are unhappy.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy are you so unhappy, mother?\u201d asked Adelaida, who alone of all the company seemed to have preserved her good temper and spirits up to now.",
            "\u201cIn the first place, because of my carefully brought-up daughters,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly; \u201cand as that is the best reason I can give you we need not bother about any other at present. Enough of words, now! We shall see how both of you (I don\u2019t count Aglaya) will manage your business, and whether you, most revered Alexandra Ivanovna, will be happy with your fine mate.\u201d",
            "\u201cAh!\u201d she added, as Gania suddenly entered the room, \u201chere\u2019s another marrying subject. How do you do?\u201d she continued, in response to Gania\u2019s bow; but she did not invite him to sit down. \u201cYou are going to be married?\u201d",
            "\u201cMarried? how\u2014what marriage?\u201d murmured Gania, overwhelmed with confusion.",
            "\u201cAre you about to take a wife? I ask,\u2014if you prefer that expression.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no I\u2014I\u2014no!\u201d said Gania, bringing out his lie with a tell-tale blush of shame. He glanced keenly at Aglaya, who was sitting some way off, and dropped his eyes immediately.",
            "Aglaya gazed coldly, intently, and composedly at him, without taking her eyes off his face, and watched his confusion.",
            "\u201cNo? You say no, do you?\u201d continued the pitiless Mrs. General. \u201cVery well, I shall remember that you told me this Wednesday morning, in answer to my question, that you are not going to be married. What day is it, Wednesday, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I think so!\u201d said Adelaida.",
            "\u201cYou never know the day of the week; what\u2019s the day of the month?\u201d",
            "\u201cTwenty-seventh!\u201d said Gania.",
            "\u201cTwenty-seventh; very well. Good-bye now; you have a good deal to do, I\u2019m sure, and I must dress and go out. Take your portrait. Give my respects to your unfortunate mother, Nina Alexandrovna. _Au revoir_, dear prince, come in and see us often, do; and I shall tell old Princess Bielokonski about you. I shall go and see her on purpose. And listen, my dear boy, I feel sure that God has sent you to Petersburg from Switzerland on purpose for me. Maybe you will have other things to do, besides, but you are sent chiefly for my sake, I feel sure of it. God sent you to me! _Au revoir!_ Alexandra, come with me, my dear.\u201d",
            "Mrs. Epanchin left the room.",
            "Gania\u2014confused, annoyed, furious\u2014took up his portrait, and turned to the prince with a nasty smile on his face.",
            "\u201cPrince,\u201d he said, \u201cI am just going home. If you have not changed your mind as to living with us, perhaps you would like to come with me. You don\u2019t know the address, I believe?\u201d",
            "\u201cWait a minute, prince,\u201d said Aglaya, suddenly rising from her seat, \u201cdo write something in my album first, will you? Father says you are a most talented caligraphist; I\u2019ll bring you my book in a minute.\u201d She left the room.",
            "\u201cWell, _au revoir_, prince,\u201d said Adelaida, \u201cI must be going too.\u201d She pressed the prince\u2019s hand warmly, and gave him a friendly smile as she left the room. She did not so much as look at Gania.",
            "\u201cThis is your doing, prince,\u201d said Gania, turning on the latter so soon as the others were all out of the room. \u201cThis is your doing, sir! _You_ have been telling them that I am going to be married!\u201d He said this in a hurried whisper, his eyes flashing with rage and his face ablaze. \u201cYou shameless tattler!\u201d",
            "\u201cI assure you, you are under a delusion,\u201d said the prince, calmly and politely. \u201cI did not even know that you were to be married.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou heard me talking about it, the general and me. You heard me say that everything was to be settled today at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s, and you went and blurted it out here. You lie if you deny it. Who else could have told them? Devil take it, sir, who could have told them except yourself? Didn\u2019t the old woman as good as hint as much to me?\u201d",
            "\u201cIf she hinted to you who told her you must know best, of course; but I never said a word about it.\u201d",
            "\u201cDid you give my note? Is there an answer?\u201d interrupted Gania, impatiently.",
            "But at this moment Aglaya came back, and the prince had no time to reply.",
            "\u201cThere, prince,\u201d said she, \u201cthere\u2019s my album. Now choose a page and write me something, will you? There\u2019s a pen, a new one; do you mind a steel one? I have heard that you caligraphists don\u2019t like steel pens.\u201d",
            "Conversing with the prince, Aglaya did not even seem to notice that Gania was in the room. But while the prince was getting his pen ready, finding a page, and making his preparations to write, Gania came up to the fireplace where Aglaya was standing, to the right of the prince, and in trembling, broken accents said, almost in her ear:",
            "\u201cOne word, just one word from you, and I\u2019m saved.\u201d",
            "The prince turned sharply round and looked at both of them. Gania\u2019s face was full of real despair; he seemed to have said the words almost unconsciously and on the impulse of the moment.",
            "Aglaya gazed at him for some seconds with precisely the same composure and calm astonishment as she had shown a little while before, when the prince handed her the note, and it appeared that this calm surprise and seemingly absolute incomprehension of what was said to her, were more terribly overwhelming to Gania than even the most plainly expressed disdain would have been.",
            "\u201cWhat shall I write?\u201d asked the prince.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll dictate to you,\u201d said Aglaya, coming up to the table. \u201cNow then, are you ready? Write, \u2018I never condescend to bargain!\u2019 Now put your name and the date. Let me see it.\u201d",

            "\u201cCapital! How beautifully you have written it! Thanks so much. _Au revoir_, prince. Wait a minute,\u201d she added, \u201cI want to give you something for a keepsake. Come with me this way, will you?\u201d",
            "The prince followed her. Arrived at the dining-room, she stopped.",
            "\u201cRead this,\u201d she said, handing him Gania\u2019s note.",
            "The prince took it from her hand, but gazed at her in bewilderment.",
            "\u201cOh! I _know_ you haven\u2019t read it, and that you could never be that man\u2019s accomplice. Read it, I wish you to read it.\u201d",

            "\u201cMy fate is to be decided today\u201d (it ran), \u201cyou know how. This day I must give my word irrevocably. I have no right to ask your help, and I dare not allow myself to indulge in any hopes; but once you said just one word, and that word lighted up the night of my life, and became the beacon of my days. Say one more such word, and save me from utter ruin. Only tell me, \u2018break off the whole thing!\u2019 and I will do so this very day. Oh! what can it cost you to say just this one word? In doing so you will but be giving me a sign of your sympathy for me, and of your pity; only this, only this; nothing more, _nothing_. I dare not indulge in any hope, because I am unworthy of it. But if you say but this word, I will take up my cross again with joy, and return once more to my battle with poverty. I shall meet the storm and be glad of it; I shall rise up with renewed strength.     \u201cSend me back then this one word of sympathy, only sympathy, I     swear to you; and oh! do not be angry with the audacity of despair,     with the drowning man who has dared to make this last effort to     save himself from perishing beneath the waters.",

            " \u201cThis man assures me,\u201d said Aglaya, scornfully, when the prince had finished reading the letter, \u201cthat the words \u2018break off everything\u2019 do not commit me to anything whatever; and himself gives me a written guarantee to that effect, in this letter. Observe how ingenuously he underlines certain words, and how crudely he glosses over his hidden thoughts. He must know that if he \u2018broke off everything,\u2019 _first_, by himself, and without telling me a word about it or having the slightest hope on my account, that in that case I should perhaps be able to change my opinion of him, and even accept his\u2014friendship. He must know that, but his soul is such a wretched thing. He knows it and cannot make up his mind; he knows it and yet asks for guarantees. He cannot bring himself to _trust_, he wants me to give him hopes of myself before he lets go of his hundred thousand roubles. As to the \u2018former word\u2019 which he declares \u2018lighted up the night of his life,\u2019 he is simply an impudent liar; I merely pitied him once. But he is audacious and shameless. He immediately began to hope, at that very moment. I saw it. He has tried to catch me ever since; he is still fishing for me. Well, enough of this. Take the letter and give it back to him, as soon as you have left our house; not before, of course.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd what shall I tell him by way of answer?\u201d",
            "\u201cNothing\u2014of course! That\u2019s the best answer. Is it the case that you are going to live in his house?\u201d",

She said that if you had done this without bargaining with her, if you had broken with the money prospects without trying to force a guarantee out of her first, she might have been your friend. That\u2019s all, I think. Oh no, when I asked her what I was to say, as I took the letter, she replied that \u2018no answer is the best answer.\u2019 I think that was it.

            "\u201cOh! I suppose the present she wished to make to you, when she took you into the dining-room, was her confidence, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI suppose that was it; I cannot explain it otherwise.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut why, _why?_ Devil take it, what did you do in there? Why did they fancy you? Look here, can\u2019t you remember exactly what you said to them, from the very beginning? Can\u2019t you remember?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, we talked of a great many things. When first I went in we began to speak of Switzerland.\u201d",

            "\u201cThen about executions.\u201d",
            "\u201cExecutions?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014at least about one. Then I told the whole three years\u2019 story of my life, and the history of a poor peasant girl\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, damn the peasant girl! go on, go on!\u201d said Gania, impatiently.",

            "\u201cOh, _curse_ Schneider and his dirty opinions! Go on.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen I began to talk about faces, at least about the _expressions_ of faces, and said that Aglaya Ivanovna was nearly as lovely as Nastasia Philipovna. It was then I blurted out about the portrait\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cBut you didn\u2019t repeat what you heard in the study? You didn\u2019t repeat that\u2014eh?\u201d",

            "Gania having once descended to abuse, and receiving no check, very soon knew no bounds or limit to his licence, as is often the way in such cases. His rage so blinded him that he had not even been able to detect that this \u201cidiot,\u201d whom he was abusing to such an extent, was very far from being slow of comprehension, and had a way of taking in an impression, and afterwards giving it out again, which was very un-idiotic indeed. But something a little unforeseen now occurred.",
            "\u201cI think I ought to tell you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch,\u201d said the prince, suddenly, \u201cthat though I once was so ill that I really was little better than an idiot, yet now I am almost recovered, and that, therefore, it is not altogether pleasant to be called an idiot to my face. Of course your anger is excusable, considering the treatment you have just experienced; but I must remind you that you have twice abused me rather rudely. I do not like this sort of thing, and especially so at the first time of meeting a man, and, therefore, as we happen to be at this moment standing at a crossroad, don\u2019t you think we had better part, you to the left, homewards, and I to the right, here? I have twenty-five roubles, and I shall easily find a lodging.\u201d",
            "Gania was much confused, and blushed for shame \u201cDo forgive me, prince!\u201d he cried, suddenly changing his abusive tone for one of great courtesy. \u201cFor Heaven\u2019s sake, forgive me! You see what a miserable plight I am in, but you hardly know anything of the facts of the case as yet. If you did, I am sure you would forgive me, at least partially. Of course it was inexcusable of me, I know, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, dear me, I really do not require such profuse apologies,\u201d replied the prince, hastily. \u201cI quite understand how unpleasant your position is, and that is what made you abuse me. So come along to your house, after all. I shall be delighted\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI am not going to let him go like this,\u201d thought Gania, glancing angrily at the prince as they walked along. \u201cThe fellow has sucked everything out of me, and now he takes off his mask\u2014there\u2019s something more than appears, here we shall see. It shall all be as clear as water by tonight, everything!\u201d",

        "VIII.": [
            "The flat was divided by a passage which led straight out of the entrance-hall. Along one side of this corridor lay the three rooms which were designed for the accommodation of the \u201chighly recommended\u201d lodgers. Besides these three rooms there was another small one at the end of the passage, close to the kitchen, which was allotted to General Ivolgin, the nominal master of the house, who slept on a wide sofa, and was obliged to pass into and out of his room through the kitchen, and up or down the back stairs. Colia, Gania\u2019s young brother, a school-boy of thirteen, shared this room with his father. He, too, had to sleep on an old sofa, a narrow, uncomfortable thing with a torn rug over it; his chief duty being to look after his father, who needed to be watched more and more every day.",
            "The prince was given the middle room of the three, the first being occupied by one Ferdishenko, while the third was empty.",
            "But Gania first conducted the prince to the family apartments. These consisted of a \u201csalon,\u201d which became the dining-room when required; a drawing-room, which was only a drawing-room in the morning, and became Gania\u2019s study in the evening, and his bedroom at night; and lastly Nina Alexandrovna\u2019s and Varvara\u2019s bedroom, a small, close chamber which they shared together.",
            "In a word, the whole place was confined, and a \u201ctight fit\u201d for the party. Gania used to grind his teeth with rage over the state of affairs; though he was anxious to be dutiful and polite to his mother. However, it was very soon apparent to anyone coming into the house, that Gania was the tyrant of the family.",
            "Nina Alexandrovna and her daughter were both seated in the drawing-room, engaged in knitting, and talking to a visitor, Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin.",
            "The lady of the house appeared to be a woman of about fifty years of age, thin-faced, and with black lines under the eyes. She looked ill and rather sad; but her face was a pleasant one for all that; and from the first word that fell from her lips, any stranger would at once conclude that she was of a serious and particularly sincere nature. In spite of her sorrowful expression, she gave the idea of possessing considerable firmness and decision.",
            "Her dress was modest and simple to a degree, dark and elderly in style; but both her face and appearance gave evidence that she had seen better days.",
            "Varvara was a girl of some twenty-three summers, of middle height, thin, but possessing a face which, without being actually beautiful, had the rare quality of charm, and might fascinate even to the extent of passionate regard.",
            "She was very like her mother: she even dressed like her, which proved that she had no taste for smart clothes. The expression of her grey eyes was merry and gentle, when it was not, as lately, too full of thought and anxiety. The same decision and firmness was to be observed in her face as in her mother\u2019s, but her strength seemed to be more vigorous than that of Nina Alexandrovna. She was subject to outbursts of temper, of which even her brother was a little afraid.",
            "The present visitor, Ptitsin, was also afraid of her. This was a young fellow of something under thirty, dressed plainly, but neatly. His manners were good, but rather ponderously so. His dark beard bore evidence to the fact that he was not in any government employ. He could speak well, but preferred silence. On the whole he made a decidedly agreeable impression. He was clearly attracted by Varvara, and made no secret of his feelings. She trusted him in a friendly way, but had not shown him any decided encouragement as yet, which fact did not quell his ardour in the least.",
            "Nina Alexandrovna was very fond of him, and had grown quite confidential with him of late. Ptitsin, as was well known, was engaged in the business of lending out money on good security, and at a good rate of interest. He was a great friend of Gania\u2019s.",
            "After a formal introduction by Gania (who greeted his mother very shortly, took no notice of his sister, and immediately marched Ptitsin out of the room), Nina Alexandrovna addressed a few kind words to the prince and forthwith requested Colia, who had just appeared at the door, to show him to the \u201cmiddle room.\u201d",
            "Colia was a nice-looking boy. His expression was simple and confiding, and his manners were very polite and engaging.",
            "\u201cWhere\u2019s your luggage?\u201d he asked, as he led the prince away to his room.",
            "\u201cI had a bundle; it\u2019s in the entrance hall.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll bring it you directly. We only have a cook and one maid, so I have to help as much as I can. Varia looks after things, generally, and loses her temper over it. Gania says you have only just arrived from Switzerland?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs it jolly there?\u201d",

            "\u201cNo; a bundle\u2014your brother has just gone to the hall for it.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing there except this,\u201d said Colia, returning at this moment. \u201cWhere did you put it?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! but that\u2019s all I have,\u201d said the prince, taking it.",
            "\u201cAh! I thought perhaps Ferdishenko had taken it.\u201d",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Varia, severely. She seemed put out, and was only just polite with the prince.",
            "\u201cOho!\u201d laughed the boy, \u201cyou can be nicer than that to _me_, you know\u2014I\u2019m not Ptitsin!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou ought to be whipped, Colia, you silly boy. If you want anything\u201d (to the prince) \u201cplease apply to the servant. We dine at half-past four. You can take your dinner with us, or have it in your room, just as you please. Come along, Colia, don\u2019t disturb the prince.\u201d",
            "At the door they met Gania coming in.",
            "\u201cIs father in?\u201d he asked. Colia whispered something in his ear and went out.",
            "\u201cJust a couple of words, prince, if you\u2019ll excuse me. Don\u2019t blab over _there_ about what you may see here, or in this house as to all that about Aglaya and me, you know. Things are not altogether pleasant in this establishment\u2014devil take it all! You\u2019ll see. At all events keep your tongue to yourself for _today_.\u201d",
            "\u201cI assure you I \u2018blabbed\u2019 a great deal less than you seem to suppose,\u201d said the prince, with some annoyance. Clearly the relations between Gania and himself were by no means improving.",
            "\u201cOh well; I caught it quite hot enough today, thanks to you. However, I forgive you.\u201d",
            "\u201cI think you might fairly remember that I was not in any way bound, I had no reason to be silent about that portrait. You never asked me not to mention it.\u201d",
            "\u201cPfu! what a wretched room this is\u2014dark, and the window looking into the yard. Your coming to our house is, in no respect, opportune. However, it\u2019s not _my_ affair. I don\u2019t keep the lodgings.\u201d",
            "Ptitsin here looked in and beckoned to Gania, who hastily left the room, in spite of the fact that he had evidently wished to say something more and had only made the remark about the room to gain time. The prince had hardly had time to wash and tidy himself a little when the door opened once more, and another figure appeared.",
            "This was a gentleman of about thirty, tall, broad-shouldered, and red-haired; his face was red, too, and he possessed a pair of thick lips, a wide nose, small eyes, rather bloodshot, and with an ironical expression in them; as though he were perpetually winking at someone. His whole appearance gave one the idea of impudence; his dress was shabby.",
            "He opened the door just enough to let his head in. His head remained so placed for a few seconds while he quietly scrutinized the room; the door then opened enough to admit his body; but still he did not enter. He stood on the threshold and examined the prince carefully. At last he gave the door a final shove, entered, approached the prince, took his hand and seated himself and the owner of the room on two chairs side by side.",
            "\u201cFerdishenko,\u201d he said, gazing intently and inquiringly into the prince\u2019s eyes.",
            "\u201cVery well, what next?\u201d said the latter, almost laughing in his face.",
            "\u201cA lodger here,\u201d continued the other, staring as before.",
            "\u201cDo you wish to make acquaintance?\u201d asked the prince.",
            "\u201cAh!\u201d said the visitor, passing his fingers through his hair and sighing. He then looked over to the other side of the room and around it. \u201cGot any money?\u201d he asked, suddenly.",
            "\u201cNot much.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow much?\u201d",

            "\u201cLet\u2019s see it.\u201d",
            "The prince took his banknote out and showed it to Ferdishenko. The latter unfolded it and looked at it; then he turned it round and examined the other side; then he held it up to the light.",
            "\u201cHow strange that it should have browned so,\u201d he said, reflectively. \u201cThese twenty-five rouble notes brown in a most extraordinary way, while other notes often grow paler. Take it.\u201d",
            "The prince took his note. Ferdishenko rose.",
            "\u201cI came here to warn you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the first place, don\u2019t lend me any money, for I shall certainly ask you to.\u201d",

            "\u201cOh! I _don\u2019t_ intend to. Thanks. I live here, next door to you; you noticed a room, did you? Don\u2019t come to me very often; I shall see you here quite often enough. Have you seen the general?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo.\u201d",

            "\u201cWell, you\u2019ll both hear and see him soon; he even tries to borrow money from me. _Avis au lecteur._ Good-bye; do you think a man can possibly live with a name like Ferdishenko?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy not?\u201d",
            "\u201cGood-bye.\u201d",
            "And so he departed. The prince found out afterwards that this gentleman made it his business to amaze people with his originality and wit, but that it did not as a rule \u201ccome off.\u201d He even produced a bad impression on some people, which grieved him sorely; but he did not change his ways for all that.",
            "As he went out of the prince\u2019s room, he collided with yet another visitor coming in. Ferdishenko took the opportunity of making several warning gestures to the prince from behind the new arrival\u2019s back, and left the room in conscious pride.",
            "This next arrival was a tall red-faced man of about fifty-five, with greyish hair and whiskers, and large eyes which stood out of their sockets. His appearance would have been distinguished had it not been that he gave the idea of being rather dirty. He was dressed in an old coat, and he smelled of vodka when he came near. His walk was effective, and he clearly did his best to appear dignified, and to impress people by his manner.",
            "This gentleman now approached the prince slowly, and with a most courteous smile; silently took his hand and held it in his own, as he examined the prince\u2019s features as though searching for familiar traits therein.",
            "\u201c\u2018Tis he, \u2018tis he!\u201d he said at last, quietly, but with much solemnity. \u201cAs though he were alive once more. I heard the familiar name\u2014the dear familiar name\u2014and, oh! how it reminded me of the irrevocable past\u2014Prince Muishkin, I believe?\u201d",
            "\u201cExactly so.\u201d",

            "\u201cLvovitch,\u201d repeated the general without the slightest haste, and with perfect confidence, just as though he had not committed himself the least in the world, but merely made a little slip of the tongue. He sat down, and taking the prince\u2019s hand, drew him to a seat next to himself.",
            "\u201cI carried you in my arms as a baby,\u201d he observed.",
            "\u201cReally?\u201d asked the prince. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s twenty years since my father died.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, yes\u2014twenty years and three months. We were educated together; I went straight into the army, and he\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cMy father went into the army, too. He was a sub-lieutenant in the Vasiliefsky regiment.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, sir\u2014in the Bielomirsky; he changed into the latter shortly before his death. I was at his bedside when he died, and gave him my blessing for eternity. Your mother\u2014\u201d The general paused, as though overcome with emotion.",
            "\u201cShe died a few months later, from a cold,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cOh, not cold\u2014believe an old man\u2014not from a cold, but from grief for her prince. Oh\u2014your mother, your mother! heigh-ho! Youth\u2014youth! Your father and I\u2014old friends as we were\u2014nearly murdered each other for her sake.\u201d",

He came and woke me at seven o\u2019clock one morning. I rise and dress in amazement; silence on both sides. I understand it all. He takes a couple of pistols out of his pocket\u2014across a handkerchief\u2014without witnesses. Why invite witnesses when both of us would be walking in eternity in a couple of minutes? The pistols are loaded; we stretch the handkerchief and stand opposite one another. We aim the pistols at each other\u2019s hearts. Suddenly tears start to our eyes, our hands shake; we weep, we embrace\u2014the battle is one of self-sacrifice now! The prince shouts, \u2018She is yours;\u2019 I cry, \u2018She is yours\u2014\u2019 in a word, in a word\u2014You\u2019ve come to live with us, hey?\u201d",

We have to let lodgings because we are poor\u2014a dreadful, unheard-of come-down for us\u2014for me, who should have been a governor-general; but we are very glad to have _you_, at all events.

I shall lie at the threshold, and she shall trample me underfoot if she does. I hardly talk to Gania now, and avoid him as much as I can.

            "\u201cOh! it was the Kolpakoff business, and of course he would have been acquitted.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes? Do you know that for a fact?\u201d asked the prince, whose curiosity was aroused by the general\u2019s words.",
            "\u201cI should think so indeed!\u201d cried the latter. \u201cThe court-martial came to no decision. It was a mysterious, an impossible business, one might say! Captain Larionoff, commander of the company, had died; his command was handed over to the prince for the moment. Very well. This soldier, Kolpakoff, stole some leather from one of his comrades, intending to sell it, and spent the money on drink. Well! The prince\u2014you understand that what follows took place in the presence of the sergeant-major, and a corporal\u2014the prince rated Kolpakoff soundly, and threatened to have him flogged. Well, Kolpakoff went back to the barracks, lay down on a camp bedstead, and in a quarter of an hour was dead: you quite understand? It was, as I said, a strange, almost impossible, affair. In due course Kolpakoff was buried; the prince wrote his report, the deceased\u2019s name was removed from the roll. All as it should be, is it not? But exactly three months later at the inspection of the brigade, the man Kolpakoff was found in the third company of the second battalion of infantry, Novozemlianski division, just as if nothing had happened!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat?\u201d said the prince, much astonished.",
            "\u201cIt did not occur\u2014it\u2019s a mistake!\u201d said Nina Alexandrovna quickly, looking, at the prince rather anxiously. \u201c_Mon mari se trompe_,\u201d she added, speaking in French.",
            "\u201cMy dear, \u2018_se trompe_\u2019 is easily said. Do you remember any case at all like it? Everybody was at their wits\u2019 end. I should be the first to say \u2018_qu\u2019on se trompe_,\u2019 but unfortunately I was an eye-witness, and was also on the commission of inquiry. Everything proved that it was really he, the very same soldier Kolpakoff who had been given the usual military funeral to the sound of the drum. It is of course a most curious case\u2014nearly an impossible one. I recognize that... but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cFather, your dinner is ready,\u201d said Varvara at this point, putting her head in at the door.",
            "\u201cVery glad, I\u2019m particularly hungry. Yes, yes, a strange coincidence\u2014almost a psychological\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYour soup\u2019ll be cold; do come.\u201d",
            "\u201cComing, coming,\u201d said the general. \u201cSon of my old friend\u2014\u201d he was heard muttering as he went down the passage.",
            "\u201cYou will have to excuse very much in my husband, if you stay with us,\u201d said Nina Alexandrovna; \u201cbut he will not disturb you often. He dines alone. Everyone has his little peculiarities, you know, and some people perhaps have more than those who are most pointed at and laughed at. One thing I must beg of you\u2014if my husband applies to you for payment for board and lodging, tell him that you have already paid me. Of course anything paid by you to the general would be as fully settled as if paid to me, so far as you are concerned; but I wish it to be so, if you please, for convenience\u2019 sake. What is it, Varia?\u201d",
            "Varia had quietly entered the room, and was holding out the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna to her mother.",
            "Nina Alexandrovna started, and examined the photograph intently, gazing at it long and sadly. At last she looked up inquiringly at Varia.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a present from herself to him,\u201d said Varia; \u201cthe question is to be finally decided this evening.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis evening!\u201d repeated her mother in a tone of despair, but softly, as though to herself. \u201cThen it\u2019s all settled, of course, and there\u2019s no hope left to us. She has anticipated her answer by the present of her portrait. Did he show it you himself?\u201d she added, in some surprise.",
            "\u201cYou know we have hardly spoken to each other for a whole month. Ptitsin told me all about it; and the photo was lying under the table, and I picked it up.\u201d",
            "\u201cPrince,\u201d asked Nina Alexandrovna, \u201cI wanted to inquire whether you have known my son long? I think he said that you had only arrived today from somewhere.\u201d",
            "The prince gave a short narrative of what we have heard before, leaving out the greater part. The two ladies listened intently.",
            "\u201cI did not ask about Gania out of curiosity,\u201d said the elder, at last. \u201cI wish to know how much you know about him, because he said just now that we need not stand on ceremony with you. What, exactly, does that mean?\u201d",
            "At this moment Gania and Ptitsin entered the room together, and Nina Alexandrovna immediately became silent again. The prince remained seated next to her, but Varia moved to the other end of the room; the portrait of Nastasia Philipovna remained lying as before on the work-table. Gania observed it there, and with a frown of annoyance snatched it up and threw it across to his writing-table, which stood at the other end of the room.",
            "\u201cIs it today, Gania?\u201d asked Nina Alexandrovna, at last.",
            "\u201cIs what today?\u201d cried the former. Then suddenly recollecting himself, he turned sharply on the prince. \u201cOh,\u201d he growled, \u201cI see, you are here, that explains it! Is it a disease, or what, that you can\u2019t hold your tongue? Look here, understand once for all, prince\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI am to blame in this, Gania\u2014no one else,\u201d said Ptitsin.",
            "Gania glanced inquiringly at the speaker.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s better so, you know, Gania\u2014especially as, from one point of view, the matter may be considered as settled,\u201d said Ptitsin; and sitting down a little way from the table he began to study a paper covered with pencil writing.",
            "Gania stood and frowned, he expected a family scene. He never thought of apologizing to the prince, however.",
            "\u201cIf it\u2019s all settled, Gania, then of course Mr. Ptitsin is right,\u201d said Nina Alexandrovna. \u201cDon\u2019t frown. You need not worry yourself, Gania; I shall ask you no questions. You need not tell me anything you don\u2019t like. I assure you I have quite submitted to your will.\u201d She said all this, knitting away the while as though perfectly calm and composed.",
            "Gania was surprised, but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother, hoping that she would express herself more clearly. Nina Alexandrovna observed his cautiousness and added, with a bitter smile:",
            "\u201cYou are still suspicious, I see, and do not believe me; but you may be quite at your ease. There shall be no more tears, nor questions\u2014not from my side, at all events. All I wish is that you may be happy, you know that. I have submitted to my fate; but my heart will always be with you, whether we remain united, or whether we part. Of course I only answer for myself\u2014you can hardly expect your sister\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cMy sister again,\u201d cried Gania, looking at her with contempt and almost hate. \u201cLook here, mother, I have already given you my word that I shall always respect you fully and absolutely, and so shall everyone else in this house, be it who it may, who shall cross this threshold.\u201d",
            "Gania was so much relieved that he gazed at his mother almost affectionately.",
            "\u201cI was not at all afraid for myself, Gania, as you know well. It was not for my own sake that I have been so anxious and worried all this time! They say it is all to be settled to-day. What is to be settled?\u201d",
            "\u201cShe has promised to tell me tonight at her own house whether she consents or not,\u201d replied Gania.",
            "\u201cWe have been silent on this subject for three weeks,\u201d said his mother, \u201cand it was better so; and now I will only ask you one question. How can she give her consent and make you a present of her portrait when you do not love her? How can such a\u2014such a\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cPractised hand\u2014eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI was not going to express myself so. But how could you so blind her?\u201d",
            "Nina Alexandrovna\u2019s question betrayed intense annoyance. Gania waited a moment and then said, without taking the trouble to conceal the irony of his tone:",
            "\u201cThere you are, mother, you are always like that. You begin by promising that there are to be no reproaches or insinuations or questions, and here you are beginning them at once. We had better drop the subject\u2014we had, really. I shall never leave you, mother; any other man would cut and run from such a sister as this. See how she is looking at me at this moment! Besides, how do you know that I am blinding Nastasia Philipovna? As for Varia, I don\u2019t care\u2014she can do just as she pleases. There, that\u2019s quite enough!\u201d",
            "Gania\u2019s irritation increased with every word he uttered, as he walked up and down the room. These conversations always touched the family sores before long.",
            "\u201cI have said already that the moment she comes in I go out, and I shall keep my word,\u201d remarked Varia.",
            "\u201cOut of obstinacy\u201d shouted Gania. \u201cYou haven\u2019t married, either, thanks to your obstinacy. Oh, you needn\u2019t frown at me, Varvara! You can go at once for all I care; I am sick enough of your company. What, you are going to leave us are you, too?\u201d he cried, turning to the prince, who was rising from his chair.",
            "Gania\u2019s voice was full of the most uncontrolled and uncontrollable irritation.",
            "The prince turned at the door to say something, but perceiving in Gania\u2019s expression that there was but that one drop wanting to make the cup overflow, he changed his mind and left the room without a word. A few minutes later he was aware from the noisy voices in the drawing room, that the conversation had become more quarrelsome than ever after his departure.",
            "He crossed the salon and the entrance-hall, so as to pass down the corridor into his own room. As he came near the front door he heard someone outside vainly endeavouring to ring the bell, which was evidently broken, and only shook a little, without emitting any sound.",
            "The prince took down the chain and opened the door. He started back in amazement\u2014for there stood Nastasia Philipovna. He knew her at once from her photograph. Her eyes blazed with anger as she looked at him. She quickly pushed by him into the hall, shouldering him out of her way, and said, furiously, as she threw off her fur cloak:",
            "\u201cIf you are too lazy to mend your bell, you should at least wait in the hall to let people in when they rattle the bell handle. There, now, you\u2019ve dropped my fur cloak\u2014dummy!\u201d",
            "Sure enough the cloak was lying on the ground. Nastasia had thrown it off her towards the prince, expecting him to catch it, but the prince had missed it.",
            "\u201cNow then\u2014announce me, quick!\u201d",
            "The prince wanted to say something, but was so confused and astonished that he could not. However, he moved off towards the drawing-room with the cloak over his arm.",
            "\u201cNow then, where are you taking my cloak to? Ha, ha, ha! Are you mad?\u201d",
            "The prince turned and came back, more confused than ever. When she burst out laughing, he smiled, but his tongue could not form a word as yet. At first, when he had opened the door and saw her standing before him, he had become as pale as death; but now the red blood had rushed back to his cheeks in a torrent.",
            "\u201cWhy, what an idiot it is!\u201d cried Nastasia, stamping her foot with irritation. \u201cGo on, do! Whom are you going to announce?\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna,\u201d murmured the prince.",
            "\u201cAnd how do you know that?\u201d she asked him, sharply.",
            "\u201cI have never seen you before!\u201d",
            "\u201cGo on, announce me\u2014what\u2019s that noise?\u201d",
            "\u201cThey are quarrelling,\u201d said the prince, and entered the drawing-room, just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis. Nina Alexandrovna had forgotten that she had \u201csubmitted to everything!\u201d She was defending Varia. Ptitsin was taking her part, too. Not that Varia was afraid of standing up for herself. She was by no means that sort of a girl; but her brother was becoming ruder and more intolerable every moment. Her usual practice in such cases as the present was to say nothing, but stare at him, without taking her eyes off his face for an instant. This manoeuvre, as she well knew, could drive Gania distracted.",
            "Just at this moment the door opened and the prince entered, announcing:",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d "
        ],
        "IX.": [
            "Nastasia\u2019s arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all parties. In the first place, she had never been before. Up to now she had been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce her to his parents. Of late she had not so much as mentioned them. Gania was partly glad of this; but still he had put it to her debit in the account to be settled after marriage.",
            "He would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. But one thing seemed to him quite clear\u2014her visit now, and the present of her portrait on this particular day, pointed out plainly enough which way she intended to make her decision!",
            "The incredulous amazement with which all regarded the prince did not last long, for Nastasia herself appeared at the door and passed in, pushing by the prince again.",
            "\u201cAt last I\u2019ve stormed the citadel! Why do you tie up your bell?\u201d she said, merrily, as she pressed Gania\u2019s hand, the latter having rushed up to her as soon as she made her appearance. \u201cWhat are you looking so upset about? Introduce me, please!\u201d",
            "The bewildered Gania introduced her first to Varia, and both women, before shaking hands, exchanged looks of strange import. Nastasia, however, smiled amiably; but Varia did not try to look amiable, and kept her gloomy expression. She did not even vouchsafe the usual courteous smile of etiquette. Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath at her for this, but Nina Alexandrovna mended matters a little when Gania introduced her at last. Hardly, however, had the old lady begun about her \u201chighly gratified feelings,\u201d and so on, when Nastasia left her, and flounced into a chair by Gania\u2019s side in the corner by the window, and cried: \u201cWhere\u2019s your study? and where are the\u2014the lodgers? You do take in lodgers, don\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "Gania looked dreadfully put out, and tried to say something in reply, but Nastasia interrupted him:",
            "\u201cWhy, where are you going to squeeze lodgers in here? Don\u2019t you use a study? Does this sort of thing pay?\u201d she added, turning to Nina Alexandrovna.",
            "\u201cWell, it is troublesome, rather,\u201d said the latter; \u201cbut I suppose it will \u2018pay\u2019 pretty well. We have only just begun, however\u2014\u201d",
            "Again Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out. She glanced at Gania, and cried, laughing, \u201cWhat a face! My goodness, what a face you have on at this moment!\u201d",
            "Indeed, Gania did not look in the least like himself. His bewilderment and his alarmed perplexity passed off, however, and his lips now twitched with rage as he continued to stare evilly at his laughing guest, while his countenance became absolutely livid.",
            "There was another witness, who, though standing at the door motionless and bewildered himself, still managed to remark Gania\u2019s death-like pallor, and the dreadful change that had come over his face. This witness was the prince, who now advanced in alarm and muttered to Gania:",
            "\u201cDrink some water, and don\u2019t look like that!\u201d",
            "It was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on the spur of the moment. But his speech was productive of much\u2014for it appeared that all Gania\u2019s rage now overflowed upon the prince. He seized him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and revenge at him, but said nothing\u2014as though his feelings were too strong to permit of words.",
            "General agitation prevailed. Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of anxiety; Ptitsin took a step forward in alarm; Colia and Ferdishenko stood stock still at the door in amazement;\u2014only Varia remained coolly watching the scene from under her eyelashes. She did not sit down, but stood by her mother with folded hands. However, Gania recollected himself almost immediately. He let go of the prince and burst out laughing.",
            "\u201cWhy, are you a doctor, prince, or what?\u201d he asked, as naturally as possible. \u201cI declare you quite frightened me! Nastasia Philipovna, let me introduce this interesting character to you\u2014though I have only known him myself since the morning.\u201d",
            "Nastasia gazed at the prince in bewilderment. \u201cPrince? He a Prince? Why, I took him for the footman, just now, and sent him in to announce me! Ha, ha, ha, isn\u2019t that good!\u201d",
            "\u201cNot bad that, not bad at all!\u201d put in Ferdishenko, \u201c_se non \u00e8 vero_\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI rather think I pitched into you, too, didn\u2019t I? Forgive me\u2014do! Who is he, did you say? What prince? Muishkin?\u201d she added, addressing Gania.",
            "\u201cHe is a lodger of ours,\u201d explained the latter.",
            "\u201cAn idiot!\u201d\u2014the prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from behind him. This was Ferdishenko\u2019s voluntary information for Nastasia\u2019s benefit.",
            "\u201cTell me, why didn\u2019t you put me right when I made such a dreadful mistake just now?\u201d continued the latter, examining the prince from head to foot without the slightest ceremony. She awaited the answer as though convinced that it would be so foolish that she must inevitably fail to restrain her laughter over it.",
            "\u201cI was astonished, seeing you so suddenly\u2014\u201d murmured the prince.",
            "\u201cHow did you know who I was? Where had you seen me before? And why were you so struck dumb at the sight of me? What was there so overwhelming about me?\u201d",
            "\u201cOho! ho, ho, ho!\u201d cried Ferdishenko. \u201c_Now_ then, prince! My word, what things I would say if I had such a chance as that! My goodness, prince\u2014go on!\u201d",
            "\u201cSo should I, in your place, I\u2019ve no doubt!\u201d laughed the prince to Ferdishenko; then continued, addressing Nastasia: \u201cYour portrait struck me very forcibly this morning; then I was talking about you to the Epanchins; and then, in the train, before I reached Petersburg, Parfen Rogojin told me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I opened the door to you I happened to be thinking of you, when\u2014there you stood before me!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd how did you recognize me?\u201d",
            "\u201cFrom the portrait!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat else?\u201d",
            "\u201cI seemed to imagine you exactly as you are\u2014I seemed to have seen you somewhere.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere\u2014where?\u201d",
            "\u201cI seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be! I have not seen you\u2014I never was here before. I may have dreamed of you, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
            "The prince said all this with manifest effort\u2014in broken sentences, and with many drawings of breath. He was evidently much agitated. Nastasia Philipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.",
            "\u201cBravo, prince!\u201d cried Ferdishenko, delighted.",
            "At this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the prince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and before them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin. He was dressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.",
            "This apparition was too much for Gania. Vain and ambitious almost to morbidness, he had had much to put up with in the last two months, and was seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a more presentable kind of existence. At home, he now adopted an attitude of absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia Philipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for all he suffered now. He was experiencing a last humiliation, the bitterest of all, at this moment\u2014the humiliation of blushing for his own kindred in his own house. A question flashed through his mind as to whether the game was really worth the candle.",
            "For that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his nightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shame\u2014the meeting between his father and Nastasia Philipovna. He had often tried to imagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and exasperating, and had quietly dropped it. Very likely he anticipated far worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain persons. He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father out of the way, anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such a meeting; but when Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so overwhelmed with astonishment, that he had not thought of his father, and had made no arrangements to keep him out of the way. And now it was too late\u2014there he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie, and Nastasia in the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family circle; of this last fact, he felt quite persuaded. What else had she come for? There were his mother and his sister sitting before her, and she seemed to have forgotten their very existence already; and if she behaved like that, he thought, she must have some object in view.",
            "Ferdishenko led the general up to Nastasia Philipovna.",
            "\u201cArdalion Alexandrovitch Ivolgin,\u201d said the smiling general, with a low bow of great dignity, \u201can old soldier, unfortunate, and the father of this family; but happy in the hope of including in that family so exquisite\u2014\u201d",
            "He did not finish his sentence, for at this moment Ferdishenko pushed a chair up from behind, and the general, not very firm on his legs, at this post-prandial hour, flopped into it backwards. It was always a difficult thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden descent left him as composed as before. He had sat down just opposite to Nastasia, whose fingers he now took, and raised to his lips with great elegance, and much courtesy. The general had once belonged to a very select circle of society, but he had been turned out of it two or three years since on account of certain weaknesses, in which he now indulged with all the less restraint; but his good manners remained with him to this day, in spite of all.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna seemed delighted at the appearance of this latest arrival, of whom she had of course heard a good deal by report.",
            "\u201cI have heard that my son\u2014\u201d began Ardalion Alexandrovitch.",
            "\u201cYour son, indeed! A nice papa you are! _You_ might have come to see me anyhow, without compromising anyone. Do you hide yourself, or does your son hide you?\u201d",

Well, I took a first-class ticket, sat down, and began to smoke, or rather _continued_ to smoke, for I had lighted up before. I was alone in the carriage. Smoking is not allowed, but is not prohibited either; it is half allowed\u2014so to speak, winked at. I had the window open.\u201d",
            "\u201cSuddenly, just before the whistle, in came two ladies with a little poodle, and sat down opposite to me; not bad-looking women; one was in light blue, the other in black silk. The poodle, a beauty with a silver collar, lay on light blue\u2019s knee. They looked haughtily about, and talked English together. I took no notice, just went on smoking. I observed that the ladies were getting angry\u2014over my cigar, doubtless. One looked at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.",
            "\u201cI took no notice, because they never said a word. If they didn\u2019t like the cigar, why couldn\u2019t they say so? Not a word, not a hint! Suddenly, and without the very slightest suspicion of warning, \u2018light blue\u2019 seizes my cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh! out of the window with it! Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young woman, tall and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me with flashing eyes.",
            "\u201cI didn\u2019t say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most refined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the poodle, took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it out of the window, after the cigar. The train went flying on, and the poodle\u2019s yells were lost in the distance.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, you naughty man!\u201d cried Nastasia, laughing and clapping her hands like a child.",
            "\u201cBravo!\u201d said Ferdishenko. Ptitsin laughed too, though he had been very sorry to see the general appear. Even Colia laughed and said, \u201cBravo!\u201d",

It turned out that \u2018light blue\u2019 was an Englishwoman, governess or something, at Princess Bielokonski\u2019s, and the other woman was one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski. Well, everybody knows what great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a pretty kettle of fish. All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the poodle. Six princesses in tears, and the Englishwoman shrieking!",
            "\u201cOf course I wrote an apology, and called, but they would not receive either me or my apology, and the Epanchins cut me, too!\u201d",

The cigar was snatched away exactly as you describe, and the poodle was chucked out of the window after it. The slapping came off, too, as in your case; and the girl\u2019s dress was light blue!\u201d",
            "The general blushed dreadfully; Colia blushed too; and Ptitsin turned hastily away. Ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as before. As to Gania, I need not say that he was miserable; he stood dumb and wretched and took no notice of anybody.",

            "\u201cYes, that\u2019s the man!\u201d said another voice.",
            "There was no room for doubt in the prince\u2019s mind: one of the voices was Rogojin\u2019s, and the other Lebedeff\u2019s.",
            "Gania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting no obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men marched in behind Parfen Rogojin. They were a decidedly mixed-looking collection, and some of them came in in their furs and caps. None of them were quite drunk, but all appeared to be considerably excited.",
            "They seemed to need each other\u2019s support, morally, before they dared come in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest each one was brave enough. Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at the head of his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied. He appeared to be gloomy and morose, and had clearly come with some end in view. All the rest were merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character. Besides Lebedeff there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his coat and hat, two or three others followed his example; the rest were more uncouth. They included a couple of young merchants, a man in a great-coat, a medical student, a little Pole, a small fat man who laughed continuously, and an enormously tall stout one who apparently put great faith in the strength of his fists. A couple of \u201cladies\u201d of some sort put their heads in at the front door, but did not dare come any farther. Colia promptly banged the door in their faces and locked it.",
            "\u201cHallo, Gania, you blackguard! You didn\u2019t expect Rogojin, eh?\u201d said the latter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania.",
            "But at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna. He had not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance produced a marvellous effect upon him. He grew pale, and his lips became actually blue.",
            "\u201cI suppose it is true, then!\u201d he muttered to himself, and his face took on an expression of despair. \u201cSo that\u2019s the end of it! Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?\u201d he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with ineffable malice. \u201cNow then, you\u2014\u201d",
            "He panted, and could hardly speak for agitation. He advanced into the room mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became more or less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement. His followers entered after him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. Of course their modesty was not fated to be long-lived, but for a moment they were abashed. Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing on earth should disconcert them.",
            "\u201cWhat, you here too, prince?\u201d said Rogojin, absently, but a little surprised all the same \u201cStill in your gaiters, eh?\u201d He sighed, and forgot the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to Nastasia again, as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic force.",
            "Nastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity. Gania recollected himself at last.",
            "\u201cExcuse me, sirs,\u201d he said, loudly, \u201cbut what does all this mean?\u201d He glared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks especially to their captain, Rogojin. \u201cYou are not in a stable, gentlemen, though you may think it\u2014my mother and sister are present.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I see your mother and sister,\u201d muttered Rogojin, through his teeth; and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the statement.",
            "\u201cAt all events, I must request you to step into the salon,\u201d said Gania, his rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, \u201cand then I shall inquire\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, he doesn\u2019t know me!\u201d said Rogojin, showing his teeth disagreeably. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t recognize Rogojin!\u201d He did not move an inch, however.",

            "\u201cMet me somewhere, pfu! Why, it\u2019s only three months since I lost two hundred roubles of my father\u2019s money to you, at cards. The old fellow died before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, I\u2019ve only to pull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and you\u2019d crawl on your hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; that\u2019s the sort of man you are. Why, I\u2019ve come now, at this moment, to buy you up! Oh, you needn\u2019t think that because I wear these boots I have no money. I have lots of money, my beauty,\u2014enough to buy up you and all yours together. So I shall, if I like to! I\u2019ll buy you up! I will!\u201d he yelled, apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited. \u201cOh, Nastasia Philipovna! don\u2019t turn me out! Say one word, do! Are you going to marry this man, or not?\u201d",
            "Rogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity, with the reckless daring of one appointed to die, who has nothing to lose.",
            "He awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical expression of face; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from them to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden.",
            "\u201cCertainly not; what are you thinking of? What could have induced you to ask such a question?\u201d she replied, quietly and seriously, and even, apparently, with some astonishment.",
            "\u201cNo? No?\u201d shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy. \u201cYou are not going to, after all? And they told me\u2014oh, Nastasia Philipovna\u2014they said you had promised to marry him, _him!_ As if you _could_ do it!\u2014him\u2014pooh! I don\u2019t mind saying it to everyone\u2014I\u2019d buy him off for a hundred roubles, any day pfu! Give him a thousand, or three if he likes, poor devil, and he\u2019d cut and run the day before his wedding, and leave his bride to me! Wouldn\u2019t you, Gania, you blackguard? You\u2019d take three thousand, wouldn\u2019t you? Here\u2019s the money! Look, I\u2019ve come on purpose to pay you off and get your receipt, formally. I said I\u2019d buy you up, and so I will.\u201d",
            "\u201cGet out of this, you drunken beast!\u201d cried Gania, who was red and white by turns.",
            "Rogojin\u2019s troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at this. Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfen\u2019s ear.",
            "\u201cYou\u2019re right, clerk,\u201d said the latter, \u201cyou\u2019re right, tipsy spirit\u2014you\u2019re right!\u2014Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d he added, looking at her like some lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch of audacity, \u201chere are eighteen thousand roubles, and\u2014and you shall have more\u2014.\u201d Here he threw a packet of bank-notes tied up in white paper, on the table before her, not daring to say all he wished to say.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014no!\u201d muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm. He was clearly aghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller amount should have been tried first.",
            "\u201cNo, you fool\u2014you don\u2019t know whom you are dealing with\u2014and it appears I am a fool, too!\u201d said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing glance of Nastasia. \u201cOh, curse it all! What a fool I was to listen to you!\u201d he added, with profound melancholy.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly burst out laughing.",
            "\u201cEighteen thousand roubles, for me? Why, you declare yourself a fool at once,\u201d she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa and prepared to go. Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the heart.",
            "\u201cForty thousand, then\u2014forty thousand roubles instead of eighteen! Ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by seven o\u2019clock tonight. Forty thousand roubles\u2014paid down on the nail!\u201d",
            "The scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia Philipovna continued to laugh and did not go away. Nina Alexandrovna and Varia had both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent horror, to see what would happen. Varia\u2019s eyes were all ablaze with anger; but the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She paled and trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every moment.",
            "\u201cVery well then, a _hundred_ thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this very day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your fingers\u2014come!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are mad!\u201d said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the hand. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk\u2014the police will be sent for if you don\u2019t look out. Think where you are.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, he\u2019s boasting like a drunkard,\u201d added Nastasia, as though with the sole intention of goading him.",
            "\u201cI do _not_ boast! You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day. Ptitsin, get the money, you gay usurer! Take what you like for it, but get it by the evening! I\u2019ll show that I\u2019m in earnest!\u201d cried Rogojin, working himself up into a frenzy of excitement.",
            "\u201cCome, come; what\u2019s all this?\u201d cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and angrily, coming close up to Rogojin. The unexpectedness of this sally on the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among the intruders.",
            "\u201cHalloa! what\u2019s this now?\u201d laughed Rogojin. \u201cYou come along with me, old fellow! You shall have as much to drink as you like.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, it\u2019s too horrible!\u201d cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and annoyance.",
            "\u201cSurely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?\u201d cried Varia, suddenly. She was shaking and trembling with rage.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s me, I suppose. I\u2019m the shameless creature!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna, with amused indifference. \u201cDear me, and I came\u2014like a fool, as I am\u2014to invite them over to my house for the evening! Look how your sister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch.\u201d",
            "For some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning, after his sister\u2019s speech. But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was really about to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized her by the arm like a madman.",
            "\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like to annihilate her on the spot. He was quite beside himself, and could hardly articulate his words for rage.",
            "\u201cWhat have I done? Where are you dragging me to?\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?\u201d cried Varia, looking back at her brother with proud defiance.",
            "A few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still holding her wrist tightly. Varia struggled once\u2014twice\u2014to get free; then could restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s a girl for you!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cMr. Ptitsin, I congratulate you on your choice.\u201d",
            "Gania lost his head. Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia, which would inevitably have laid her low, but suddenly another hand caught his. Between him and Varia stood the prince.",
            "\u201cEnough\u2014enough!\u201d said the latter, with insistence, but all of a tremble with excitement.",
            "\u201cAre you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!\u201d cried Gania; and, loosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the prince\u2019s face with all his force.",
            "Exclamations of horror arose on all sides. The prince grew pale as death; he gazed into Gania\u2019s eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful look; his lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then his mouth twisted into an incongruous smile.",
            "\u201cVery well\u2014never mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike her!\u201d he said, at last, quietly. Then, suddenly, he could bear it no longer, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and murmured in broken accents:",
            "\u201cOh! how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!\u201d",
            "Gania certainly did look dreadfully abashed. Colia rushed up to comfort the prince, and after him crowded Varia, Rogojin and all, even the general.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d said the prince, and again he wore the smile which was so inconsistent with the circumstances.",
            "\u201cYes, he will be ashamed!\u201d cried Rogojin. \u201cYou will be properly ashamed of yourself for having injured such a\u2014such a sheep\u201d (he could not find a better word). \u201cPrince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with me. I\u2019ll show you how Rogojin shows his affection for his friends.\u201d",
            "Nastasia Philipovna was also much impressed, both with Gania\u2019s action and with the prince\u2019s reply.",
            "Her usually thoughtful, pale face, which all this while had been so little in harmony with the jests and laughter which she had seemed to put on for the occasion, was now evidently agitated by new feelings, though she tried to conceal the fact and to look as though she were as ready as ever for jesting and irony.",
            "\u201cI really think I must have seen him somewhere!\u201d she murmured seriously enough.",

It is quite possible she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her meaning. Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. I have heard curious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why did she behave so to my mother? Ptitsin knows her very well; he says he could not understand her today.

She looks on me as a fool because I show that I meant her money, and doesn\u2019t realize that there are other men who would deceive her in far worse fashion. I\u2019m not going to pretend anything, and you\u2019ll see she\u2019ll marry me, all right. If she likes to live quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her nonsense, I shall leave her at once, but I shall keep the money.

She thinks she will be able to make a sort of slave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her. I don\u2019t know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but, I assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have not spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There are uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isn\u2019t one honester than Ptitsin, he\u2019s the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You don\u2019t know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one myself I like you. _Why_ am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They all call me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of thinking myself one. That\u2019s what is so bad about the business.\u201d",

I shall never judge again without a thorough trial. I see now that you are not only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled. I see that you are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least degree, but rather weak.\u201d",

Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a good deal worse than an innocent liar now. Do you know that he keeps a mistress? I can\u2019t understand how mother is so long-suffering. Did he tell you the story of the siege of Kars? Or perhaps the one about his grey horse that talked? He loves to enlarge on these absurd histories.\u201d And Gania burst into a fit of laughter. Suddenly he turned to the prince and asked: \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child. You came to make friends with me again just now, and you said, \u2018I will kiss your hand, if you like,\u2019 just as a child would have said it. And then, all at once you are talking of this mad project\u2014of these seventy-five thousand roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible.\u201d",

            "\u201cAh! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very well,\u201d replied Gania impatiently. \u201cThat is proved by my having this conversation with you. It is not for money only, prince, that I am rushing into this affair,\u201d he continued, hardly master of his words, so closely had his vanity been touched. \u201cIf I reckoned on that I should certainly be deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character. I am obeying a passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim, one that overmasters all else. You imagine that once I am in possession of these seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a carriage... No, I shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for three years, and I shall give up my club. I shall follow the example of men who have made their fortunes. When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept in the street, he sold pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has sixty thousand roubles, but to get them, what has he not done? Well, I shall be spared such a hard beginning, and shall start with a little capital. In fifteen years people will say, \u2018Look, that\u2019s Ivolgin, the king of the Jews!\u2019 You say that I have no originality. Now mark this, prince\u2014there is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race than to be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak in character, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary person. You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a rogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now! You wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of selling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his part, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us! This has exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will do it! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man. One of the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it can buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts. You will say that this is childish\u2014or romantic. Well, that will be all the better for me, but the thing shall be done. I will carry it through. He laughs most, who laughs last. Why does Epanchin insult me? Simply because, socially, I am a nobody. However, enough for the present. Colia has put his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice. I\u2019m dining out. I shall come and talk to you now and then; you shall be comfortable enough with us. They are sure to make you one of the family. I think you and I will either be great friends or enemies. Look here now, supposing I had kissed your hand just now, as I offered to do in all sincerity, should I have hated you for it afterwards?\u201d",
            "\u201cCertainly, but not always. You would not have been able to keep it up, and would have ended by forgiving me,\u201d said the prince, after a pause for reflection, and with a pleasant smile.",

A man, look you, who has thirteen bullets on his breast!... You don\u2019t believe it? Well, I can assure you it was entirely on my account that Pirogoff telegraphed to Paris, and left Sebastopol at the greatest risk during the siege. Nelaton, the Tuileries surgeon, demanded a safe conduct, in the name of science, into the besieged city in order to attend my wounds.

Ornaments of this city and of society: beauty, education, culture\u2014the woman question\u2014poetry\u2014everything! Added to which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least eighty thousand roubles. No bad thing, eh?... In a word I absolutely must introduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin. Tableau!\u201d",
            "\u201cAt once? Now? You must have forgotten...\u201d began the prince.",
            "\u201cNo, I have forgotten nothing. Come! This is the house\u2014up this magnificent staircase. I am surprised not to see the porter, but .... it is a holiday... and the man has gone off... Drunken fool! Why have they not got rid of him? Sokolovitch owes all the happiness he has had in the service and in his private life to me, and me alone, but... here we are.\u201d",
            "The prince followed quietly, making no further objection for fear of irritating the old man. At the same time he fervently hoped that General Sokolovitch and his family would fade away like a mirage in the desert, so that the visitors could escape, by merely returning downstairs. But to his horror he saw that General Ivolgin was quite familiar with the house, and really seemed to have friends there. At every step he named some topographical or biographical detail that left nothing to be desired on the score of accuracy. When they arrived at last, on the first floor, and the general turned to ring the bell to the right, the prince decided to run away, but a curious incident stopped him momentarily.",
            "\u201cYou have made a mistake, general,\u201d said he. \u201cThe name on the door is Koulakoff, and you were going to see General Sokolovitch.\u201d",
            "\u201cKoulakoff... Koulakoff means nothing. This is Sokolovitch\u2019s flat, and I am ringing at his door.... What do I care for Koulakoff?... Here comes someone to open.\u201d",
            "In fact, the door opened directly, and the footman informed the visitors that the family were all away.",
            "\u201cWhat a pity! What a pity! It\u2019s just my luck!\u201d repeated Ardalion Alexandrovitch over and over again, in regretful tones. \u201cWhen your master and mistress return, my man, tell them that General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin desired to present themselves, and that they were extremely sorry, excessively grieved...\u201d",
            "Just then another person belonging to the household was seen at the back of the hall. It was a woman of some forty years, dressed in sombre colours, probably a housekeeper or a governess. Hearing the names she came forward with a look of suspicion on her face.",
            "\u201cMarie Alexandrovna is not at home,\u201d said she, staring hard at the general. \u201cShe has gone to her mother\u2019s, with Alexandra Michailovna.\u201d",
            "\u201cAlexandra Michailovna out, too! How disappointing! Would you believe it, I am always so unfortunate! May I most respectfully ask you to present my compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her... tell her, that with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for herself on Thursday evening, while she was listening to Chopin\u2019s Ballade. She will remember. I wish it with all sincerity. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin!\u201d",
            "The woman\u2019s face changed; she lost her suspicious expression.",
            "\u201cI will not fail to deliver your message,\u201d she replied, and bowed them out.",
            "As they went downstairs the general regretted repeatedly that he had failed to introduce the prince to his friends.",
            "\u201cYou know I am a bit of a poet,\u201d said he. \u201cHave you noticed it? The poetic soul, you know.\u201d Then he added suddenly\u2014\u201cBut after all... after all I believe we made a mistake this time! I remember that the Sokolovitch\u2019s live in another house, and what is more, they are just now in Moscow. Yes, I certainly was at fault. However, it is of no consequence.\u201d",
            "\u201cJust tell me,\u201d said the prince in reply, \u201cmay I count still on your assistance? Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d",
            "\u201cCount on my assistance? Go alone? How can you ask me that question, when it is a matter on which the fate of my family so largely depends? You don\u2019t know Ivolgin, my friend. To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock; that\u2019s how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me. \u2018Depend upon Ivolgin,\u2019 said they all, \u2018he is as steady as a rock.\u2019 But, excuse me, I must just call at a house on our way, a house where I have found consolation and help in all my trials for years.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are going home?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo... I wish... to visit Madame Terentieff, the widow of Captain Terentieff, my old subordinate and friend. She helps me to keep up my courage, and to bear the trials of my domestic life, and as I have an extra burden on my mind today...\u201d",
            "\u201cIt seems to me,\u201d interrupted the prince, \u201cthat I was foolish to trouble you just now. However, at present you... Good-bye!\u201d",
            "\u201cIndeed, you must not go away like that, young man, you must not!\u201d cried the general. \u201cMy friend here is a widow, the mother of a family; her words come straight from her heart, and find an echo in mine. A visit to her is merely an affair of a few minutes; I am quite at home in her house. I will have a wash, and dress, and then we can drive to the Grand Theatre. Make up your mind to spend the evening with me.... We are just there\u2014that\u2019s the house... Why, Colia! you here! Well, is Marfa Borisovna at home or have you only just come?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no! I have been here a long while,\u201d replied Colia, who was at the front door when the general met him. \u201cI am keeping Hippolyte company. He is worse, and has been in bed all day. I came down to buy some cards. Marfa Borisovna expects you. But what a state you are in, father!\u201d added the boy, noticing his father\u2019s unsteady gait. \u201cWell, let us go in.\u201d",
            "On meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though he made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible. He wanted Colia, but firmly resolved to leave the general behind. He could not forgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be of any use. The three climbed up the long staircase until they reached the fourth floor where Madame Terentieff lived.",
            "\u201cYou intend to introduce the prince?\u201d asked Colia, as they went up.",
            "\u201cYes, my boy. I wish to present him: General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin! But what\u2019s the matter?... what?... How is Marfa Borisovna?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou know, father, you would have done much better not to come at all! She is ready to eat you up! You have not shown yourself since the day before yesterday and she is expecting the money. Why did you promise her any? You are always the same! Well, now you will have to get out of it as best you can.\u201d",
            "They stopped before a somewhat low doorway on the fourth floor. Ardalion Alexandrovitch, evidently much out of countenance, pushed Muishkin in front.",
            "\u201cI will wait here,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI should like to surprise her. ....\u201d",
            "Colia entered first, and as the door stood open, the mistress of the house peeped out. The surprise of the general\u2019s imagination fell very flat, for she at once began to address him in terms of reproach.",
            "Marfa Borisovna was about forty years of age. She wore a dressing-jacket, her feet were in slippers, her face painted, and her hair was in dozens of small plaits. No sooner did she catch sight of Ardalion Alexandrovitch than she screamed:",
            "\u201cThere he is, that wicked, mean wretch! I knew it was he! My heart misgave me!\u201d",
            "The old man tried to put a good face on the affair.",
            "\u201cCome, let us go in\u2014it\u2019s all right,\u201d he whispered in the prince\u2019s ear.",
            "But it was more serious than he wished to think. As soon as the visitors had crossed the low dark hall, and entered the narrow reception-room, furnished with half a dozen cane chairs, and two small card-tables, Madame Terentieff, in the shrill tones habitual to her, continued her stream of invectives.",
            "\u201cAre you not ashamed? Are you not ashamed? You barbarian! You tyrant! You have robbed me of all I possessed\u2014you have sucked my bones to the marrow. How long shall I be your victim? Shameless, dishonourable man!\u201d",
            "\u201cMarfa Borisovna! Marfa Borisovna! Here is... the Prince Muishkin! General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin,\u201d stammered the disconcerted old man.",
            "\u201cWould you believe,\u201d said the mistress of the house, suddenly addressing the prince, \u201cwould you believe that that man has not even spared my orphan children? He has stolen everything I possessed, sold everything, pawned everything; he has left me nothing\u2014nothing! What am I to do with your IOU\u2019s, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue? Answer, devourer! answer, heart of stone! How shall I feed my orphans? with what shall I nourish them? And now he has come, he is drunk! He can scarcely stand. How, oh how, have I offended the Almighty, that He should bring this curse upon me! Answer, you worthless villain, answer!\u201d",
            "But this was too much for the general.",
            "\u201cHere are twenty-five roubles, Marfa Borisovna... it is all that I can give... and I owe even these to the prince\u2019s generosity\u2014my noble friend. I have been cruelly deceived. Such is... life... Now... Excuse me, I am very weak,\u201d he continued, standing in the centre of the room, and bowing to all sides. \u201cI am faint; excuse me! Lenotchka... a cushion... my dear!\u201d",
            "Lenotchka, a little girl of eight, ran to fetch the cushion at once, and placed it on the rickety old sofa. The general meant to have said much more, but as soon as he had stretched himself out, he turned his face to the wall, and slept the sleep of the just.",
            "With a grave and ceremonious air, Marfa Borisovna motioned the prince to a chair at one of the card-tables. She seated herself opposite, leaned her right cheek on her hand, and sat in silence, her eyes fixed on Muishkin, now and again sighing deeply. The three children, two little girls and a boy, Lenotchka being the eldest, came and leant on the table and also stared steadily at him. Presently Colia appeared from the adjoining room.",
            "\u201cI am very glad indeed to have met you here, Colia,\u201d said the prince. \u201cCan you do something for me? I must see Nastasia Philipovna, and I asked Ardalion Alexandrovitch just now to take me to her house, but he has gone to sleep, as you see. Will you show me the way, for I do not know the street? I have the address, though; it is close to the Grand Theatre.\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna? She does not live there, and to tell you the truth my father has never been to her house! It is strange that you should have depended on him! She lives near Wladimir Street, at the Five Corners, and it is quite close by. Will you go directly? It is just half-past nine. I will show you the way with pleasure.\u201d",
            "Colia and the prince went off together. Alas! the latter had no money to pay for a cab, so they were obliged to walk.",
            "\u201cI should have liked to have taken you to see Hippolyte,\u201d said Colia. \u201cHe is the eldest son of the lady you met just now, and was in the next room. He is ill, and has been in bed all day. But he is rather strange, and extremely sensitive, and I thought he might be upset considering the circumstances in which you came... Somehow it touches me less, as it concerns my father, while it is _his_ mother. That, of course, makes a great difference. What is a terrible disgrace to a woman, does not disgrace a man, at least not in the same way. Perhaps public opinion is wrong in condemning one sex, and excusing the other. Hippolyte is an extremely clever boy, but so prejudiced. He is really a slave to his opinions.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you say he is consumptive?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes. It really would be happier for him to die young. If I were in his place I should certainly long for death. He is unhappy about his brother and sisters, the children you saw. If it were possible, if we only had a little money, we should leave our respective families, and live together in a little apartment of our own. It is our dream. But, do you know, when I was talking over your affair with him, he was angry, and said that anyone who did not call out a man who had given him a blow was a coward. He is very irritable to-day, and I left off arguing the matter with him. So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to go and see her?\u201d",
            "\u201cTo tell the truth, she has not.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen how do you come to be going there?\u201d cried Colia, so much astonished that he stopped short in the middle of the pavement. \u201cAnd... and are you going to her \u2018At Home\u2019 in that costume?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all. If she will receive me, so much the better. If not, the matter is ended. As to my clothes\u2014what can I do?\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of getting into her society, and that of her friends?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I have really an object in going... That is, I am going on business it is difficult to explain, but...\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want to know. The only important thing, in my eyes, is that you should not be going there simply for the pleasure of spending your evening in such company\u2014cocottes, generals, usurers! If that were the case I should despise and laugh at you. There are terribly few honest people here, and hardly any whom one can respect, although people put on airs\u2014Varia especially! Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are nowadays? Especially here, in our dear Russia. How it has happened I never can understand. There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens? Everything is exposed to the public gaze, veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers. We are for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations. Parents blush when they remember their old-fashioned morality. At Moscow lately a father was heard urging his son to stop at nothing\u2014at nothing, mind you!\u2014to get money! The press seized upon the story, of course, and now it is public property. Look at my father, the general! See what he is, and yet, I assure you, he is an honest man! Only... he drinks too much, and his morals are not all we could desire. Yes, that\u2019s true! I pity him, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would laugh at me\u2014but I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after all? Money-grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last. Hippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity. He talks about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital; the devil knows what he means. It makes me angry to hear him talk so, but he is soured by his troubles. Just imagine\u2014the general keeps his mother\u2014but she lends him money! She lends it for a week or ten days at very high interest! Isn\u2019t it disgusting? And then, you would hardly believe it, but my mother\u2014Nina Alexandrovna\u2014helps Hippolyte in all sorts of ways, sends him money and clothes. She even goes as far as helping the children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares nothing about them, and Varia does the same.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about, that there were only money-grubbers\u2014and here they are quite close at hand, these honest and good people, your mother and Varia! I think there is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in such circumstances.\u201d",
            "\u201cVaria does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself airs. As to my mother, I really do admire her\u2014yes, and honour her. Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and thought it vulgar of her\u2014but now, he is sometimes quite touched and overcome by her kindness. H\u2019m! You call that being strong and good? I will remember that! Gania knows nothing about it. He would say that it was encouraging vice.\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, Gania knows nothing about it? It seems there are many things that Gania does not know,\u201d exclaimed the prince, as he considered Colia\u2019s last words.",
            "\u201cDo you know, I like you very much indeed, prince? I shall never forget about this afternoon.\u201d",
            "\u201cI like you too, Colia.\u201d",
            "\u201cListen to me! You are going to live here, are you not?\u201d said Colia. \u201cI mean to get something to do directly, and earn money. Then shall we three live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat, and let the general come and visit us. What do you say?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt would be very pleasant,\u201d returned the prince. \u201cBut we must see. I am really rather worried just now. What! are we there already? Is that the house? What a long flight of steps! And there\u2019s a porter! Well, Colia I don\u2019t know what will come of it all.\u201d",
            "The prince seemed quite distracted for the moment.",
            "\u201cYou must tell me all about it tomorrow! Don\u2019t be afraid. I wish you success; we agree so entirely that I can do so, although I do not understand why you are here. Good-bye!\u201d cried Colia excitedly. \u201cNow I will rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals! But as to your getting in\u2014don\u2019t be in the least afraid. You will see her. She is so original about everything. It\u2019s the first floor. The porter will show you.\u201d "

            "But there was another question, which terrified him considerably, and that was: what was he going to do when he _did_ get in? And to this question he could fashion no satisfactory reply.",
            "If only he could find an opportunity of coming close up to Nastasia Philipovna and saying to her: \u201cDon\u2019t ruin yourself by marrying this man. He does not love you, he only loves your money. He told me so himself, and so did Aglaya Ivanovna, and I have come on purpose to warn you\u201d\u2014but even that did not seem quite a legitimate or practicable thing to do. Then, again, there was another delicate question, to which he could not find an answer; dared not, in fact, think of it; but at the very idea of which he trembled and blushed. However, in spite of all his fears and heart-quakings he went in, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna.",
            "Nastasia occupied a medium-sized, but distinctly tasteful, flat, beautifully furnished and arranged. At one period of these five years of Petersburg life, Totski had certainly not spared his expenditure upon her. He had calculated upon her eventual love, and tried to tempt her with a lavish outlay upon comforts and luxuries, knowing too well how easily the heart accustoms itself to comforts, and how difficult it is to tear one\u2019s self away from luxuries which have become habitual and, little by little, indispensable.",
            "Nastasia did not reject all this, she even loved her comforts and luxuries, but, strangely enough, never became, in the least degree, dependent upon them, and always gave the impression that she could do just as well without them. In fact, she went so far as to inform Totski on several occasions that such was the case, which the latter gentleman considered a very unpleasant communication indeed.",
            "But, of late, Totski had observed many strange and original features and characteristics in Nastasia, which he had neither known nor reckoned upon in former times, and some of these fascinated him, even now, in spite of the fact that all his old calculations with regard to her were long ago cast to the winds.",
            "A maid opened the door for the prince (Nastasia\u2019s servants were all females) and, to his surprise, received his request to announce him to her mistress without any astonishment. Neither his dirty boots, nor his wide-brimmed hat, nor his sleeveless cloak, nor his evident confusion of manner, produced the least impression upon her. She helped him off with his cloak, and begged him to wait a moment in the ante-room while she announced him.",
            "The company assembled at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s consisted of none but her most intimate friends, and formed a very small party in comparison with her usual gatherings on this anniversary.",
            "In the first place there were present Totski, and General Epanchin. They were both highly amiable, but both appeared to be labouring under a half-hidden feeling of anxiety as to the result of Nastasia\u2019s deliberations with regard to Gania, which result was to be made public this evening.",
            "Then, of course, there was Gania who was by no means so amiable as his elders, but stood apart, gloomy, and miserable, and silent. He had determined not to bring Varia with him; but Nastasia had not even asked after her, though no sooner had he arrived than she had reminded him of the episode between himself and the prince. The general, who had heard nothing of it before, began to listen with some interest, while Gania, drily, but with perfect candour, went through the whole history, including the fact of his apology to the prince. He finished by declaring that the prince was a most extraordinary man, and goodness knows why he had been considered an idiot hitherto, for he was very far from being one.",
            "Nastasia listened to all this with great interest; but the conversation soon turned to Rogojin and his visit, and this theme proved of the greatest attraction to both Totski and the general.",
            "Ptitsin was able to afford some particulars as to Rogojin\u2019s conduct since the afternoon. He declared that he had been busy finding money for the latter ever since, and up to nine o\u2019clock, Rogojin having declared that he must absolutely have a hundred thousand roubles by the evening. He added that Rogojin was drunk, of course; but that he thought the money would be forthcoming, for the excited and intoxicated rapture of the fellow impelled him to give any interest or premium that was asked of him, and there were several others engaged in beating up the money, also.",
            "All this news was received by the company with somewhat gloomy interest. Nastasia was silent, and would not say what she thought about it. Gania was equally uncommunicative. The general seemed the most anxious of all, and decidedly uneasy. The present of pearls which he had prepared with so much joy in the morning had been accepted but coldly, and Nastasia had smiled rather disagreeably as she took it from him. Ferdishenko was the only person present in good spirits.",
            "Totski himself, who had the reputation of being a capital talker, and was usually the life and soul of these entertainments, was as silent as any on this occasion, and sat in a state of, for him, most uncommon perturbation.",
            "The rest of the guests (an old tutor or schoolmaster, goodness knows why invited; a young man, very timid, and shy and silent; a rather loud woman of about forty, apparently an actress; and a very pretty, well-dressed German lady who hardly said a word all the evening) not only had no gift for enlivening the proceedings, but hardly knew what to say for themselves when addressed. Under these circumstances the arrival of the prince came almost as a godsend.",
            "The announcement of his name gave rise to some surprise and to some smiles, especially when it became evident, from Nastasia\u2019s astonished look, that she had not thought of inviting him. But her astonishment once over, Nastasia showed such satisfaction that all prepared to greet the prince with cordial smiles of welcome.",
            "\u201cOf course,\u201d remarked General Epanchin, \u201che does this out of pure innocence. It\u2019s a little dangerous, perhaps, to encourage this sort of freedom; but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this moment. He may enliven us a little with his originalities.\u201d",
            "\u201cEspecially as he asked himself,\u201d said Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with it?\u201d asked the general, who loathed Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cWhy, he must pay toll for his entrance,\u201d explained the latter.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! Prince Muishkin is not Ferdishenko,\u201d said the general, impatiently. This worthy gentleman could never quite reconcile himself to the idea of meeting Ferdishenko in society, and on an equal footing.",
            "\u201cOh general, spare Ferdishenko!\u201d replied the other, smiling. \u201cI have special privileges.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat do you mean by special privileges?\u201d",
            "\u201cOnce before I had the honour of stating them to the company. I will repeat the explanation to-day for your excellency\u2019s benefit. You see, excellency, all the world is witty and clever except myself. I am neither. As a kind of compensation I am allowed to tell the truth, for it is a well-known fact that only stupid people tell \u2018the truth.\u2019 Added to this, I am a spiteful man, just because I am not clever. If I am offended or injured I bear it quite patiently until the man injuring me meets with some misfortune. Then I remember, and take my revenge. I return the injury sevenfold, as Ivan Petrovitch Ptitsin says. (Of course he never does so himself.) Excellency, no doubt you recollect Kryloff\u2019s fable, \u2018The Lion and the Ass\u2019? Well now, that\u2019s you and I. That fable was written precisely for us.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou seem to be talking nonsense again, Ferdishenko,\u201d growled the general.",
            "\u201cWhat is the matter, excellency? I know how to keep my place. When I said just now that we, you and I, were the lion and the ass of Kryloff\u2019s fable, of course it is understood that I take the role of the ass. Your excellency is the lion of which the fable remarks:",
            "\u2018A mighty lion, terror of the woods, Was shorn of his great prowess by old age.\u2019",
            " And I, your excellency, am the ass.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am of your opinion on that last point,\u201d said Ivan Fedorovitch, with ill-concealed irritation.",
            "All this was no doubt extremely coarse, and moreover it was premeditated, but after all Ferdishenko had persuaded everyone to accept him as a buffoon.",
            "\u201cIf I am admitted and tolerated here,\u201d he had said one day, \u201cit is simply because I talk in this way. How can anyone possibly receive such a man as I am? I quite understand. Now, could I, a Ferdishenko, be allowed to sit shoulder to shoulder with a clever man like Afanasy Ivanovitch? There is one explanation, only one. I am given the position because it is so entirely inconceivable!\u201d",
            "But these vulgarities seemed to please Nastasia Philipovna, although too often they were both rude and offensive. Those who wished to go to her house were forced to put up with Ferdishenko. Possibly the latter was not mistaken in imagining that he was received simply in order to annoy Totski, who disliked him extremely. Gania also was often made the butt of the jester\u2019s sarcasms, who used this method of keeping in Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s good graces.",
            "\u201cThe prince will begin by singing us a fashionable ditty,\u201d remarked Ferdishenko, and looked at the mistress of the house, to see what she would say.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Ferdishenko; please be quiet,\u201d answered Nastasia Philipovna dryly.",
            "\u201cA-ah! if he is to be under special patronage, I withdraw my claws.\u201d",
            "But Nastasia Philipovna had now risen and advanced to meet the prince.",
            "\u201cI was so sorry to have forgotten to ask you to come, when I saw you,\u201d she said, \u201cand I am delighted to be able to thank you personally now, and to express my pleasure at your resolution.\u201d",
            "So saying she gazed into his eyes, longing to see whether she could make any guess as to the explanation of his motive in coming to her house. The prince would very likely have made some reply to her kind words, but he was so dazzled by her appearance that he could not speak.",
            "Nastasia noticed this with satisfaction. She was in full dress this evening; and her appearance was certainly calculated to impress all beholders. She took his hand and led him towards her other guests. But just before they reached the drawing-room door, the prince stopped her, and hurriedly and in great agitation whispered to her:",
            "\u201cYou are altogether perfection; even your pallor and thinness are perfect; one could not wish you otherwise. I did so wish to come and see you. I\u2014forgive me, please\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t apologize,\u201d said Nastasia, laughing; \u201cyou spoil the whole originality of the thing. I think what they say about you must be true, that you are so original.\u2014So you think me perfection, do you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! Well, you may be a good reader of riddles but you are wrong _there_, at all events. I\u2019ll remind you of this, tonight.\u201d",
            "Nastasia introduced the prince to her guests, to most of whom he was already known.",
            "Totski immediately made some amiable remark. All seemed to brighten up at once, and the conversation became general. Nastasia made the prince sit down next to herself.",
            "\u201cDear me, there\u2019s nothing so very curious about the prince dropping in, after all,\u201d remarked Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s quite a clear case,\u201d said the hitherto silent Gania. \u201cI have watched the prince almost all day, ever since the moment when he first saw Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s portrait, at General Epanchin\u2019s. I remember thinking at the time what I am now pretty sure of; and what, I may say in passing, the prince confessed to myself.\u201d",
            "Gania said all this perfectly seriously, and without the slightest appearance of joking; indeed, he seemed strangely gloomy.",
            "\u201cI did not confess anything to you,\u201d said the prince, blushing. \u201cI only answered your question.\u201d",
            "\u201cBravo! That\u2019s frank, at any rate!\u201d shouted Ferdishenko, and there was general laughter.",
            "\u201cOh prince, prince! I never should have thought it of you;\u201d said General Epanchin. \u201cAnd I imagined you a philosopher! Oh, you silent fellows!\u201d",
            "\u201cJudging from the fact that the prince blushed at this innocent joke, like a young girl, I should think that he must, as an honourable man, harbour the noblest intentions,\u201d said the old toothless schoolmaster, most unexpectedly; he had not so much as opened his mouth before. This remark provoked general mirth, and the old fellow himself laughed loudest of the lot, but ended with a stupendous fit of coughing.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna, who loved originality and drollery of all kinds, was apparently very fond of this old man, and rang the bell for more tea to stop his coughing. It was now half-past ten o\u2019clock.",
            "\u201cGentlemen, wouldn\u2019t you like a little champagne now?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have it all ready; it will cheer us up\u2014do now\u2014no ceremony!\u201d",
            "This invitation to drink, couched, as it was, in such informal terms, came very strangely from Nastasia Philipovna. Her usual entertainments were not quite like this; there was more style about them. However, the wine was not refused; each guest took a glass excepting Gania, who drank nothing.",
            "It was extremely difficult to account for Nastasia\u2019s strange condition of mind, which became more evident each moment, and which none could avoid noticing.",
            "She took her glass, and vowed she would empty it three times that evening. She was hysterical, and laughed aloud every other minute with no apparent reason\u2014the next moment relapsing into gloom and thoughtfulness.",
            "Some of her guests suspected that she must be ill; but concluded at last that she was expecting something, for she continued to look at her watch impatiently and unceasingly; she was most absent and strange.",
            "\u201cYou seem to be a little feverish tonight,\u201d said the actress.",
            "\u201cYes; I feel quite ill. I have been obliged to put on this shawl\u2014I feel so cold,\u201d replied Nastasia. She certainly had grown very pale, and every now and then she tried to suppress a trembling in her limbs.",
            "\u201cHad we not better allow our hostess to retire?\u201d asked Totski of the general.",
            "\u201cNot at all, gentlemen, not at all! Your presence is absolutely necessary to me tonight,\u201d said Nastasia, significantly.",
            "As most of those present were aware that this evening a certain very important decision was to be taken, these words of Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s appeared to be fraught with much hidden interest. The general and Totski exchanged looks; Gania fidgeted convulsively in his chair.",
            "\u201cLet\u2019s play at some game!\u201d suggested the actress.",
            "\u201cI know a new and most delightful game, added Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the actress.",
            "\u201cWell, when we tried it we were a party of people, like this, for instance; and somebody proposed that each of us, without leaving his place at the table, should relate something about himself. It had to be something that he really and honestly considered the very worst action he had ever committed in his life. But he was to be honest\u2014that was the chief point! He wasn\u2019t to be allowed to lie.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat an extraordinary idea!\u201d said the general.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of it, general!\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a funny notion,\u201d said Totski, \u201cand yet quite natural\u2014it\u2019s only a new way of boasting.\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps that is just what was so fascinating about it.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, it would be a game to cry over\u2014not to laugh at!\u201d said the actress.",
            "\u201cDid it succeed?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cCome, let\u2019s try it, let\u2019s try it; we really are not quite so jolly as we might be\u2014let\u2019s try it! We may like it; it\u2019s original, at all events!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes,\u201d said Ferdishenko; \u201cit\u2019s a good idea\u2014come along\u2014the men begin. Of course no one need tell a story if he prefers to be disobliging. We must draw lots! Throw your slips of paper, gentlemen, into this hat, and the prince shall draw for turns. It\u2019s a very simple game; all you have to do is to tell the story of the worst action of your life. It\u2019s as simple as anything. I\u2019ll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!\u201d",
            "No one liked the idea much. Some smiled, some frowned; some objected, but faintly, not wishing to oppose Nastasia\u2019s wishes; for this new idea seemed to be rather well received by her. She was still in an excited, hysterical state, laughing convulsively at nothing and everything. Her eyes were blazing, and her cheeks showed two bright red spots against the white. The melancholy appearance of some of her guests seemed to add to her sarcastic humour, and perhaps the very cynicism and cruelty of the game proposed by Ferdishenko pleased her. At all events she was attracted by the idea, and gradually her guests came round to her side; the thing was original, at least, and might turn out to be amusing. \u201cAnd supposing it\u2019s something that one\u2014one can\u2019t speak about before ladies?\u201d asked the timid and silent young man.",
            "\u201cWhy, then of course, you won\u2019t say anything about it. As if there are not plenty of sins to your score without the need of those!\u201d said Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cBut I really don\u2019t know which of my actions is the worst,\u201d said the lively actress.",
            "\u201cLadies are exempted if they like.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd how are you to know that one isn\u2019t lying? And if one lies the whole point of the game is lost,\u201d said Gania.",
            "\u201cOh, but think how delightful to hear how one\u2019s friends lie! Besides you needn\u2019t be afraid, Gania; everybody knows what your worst action is without the need of any lying on your part. Only think, gentlemen,\u201d\u2014and Ferdishenko here grew quite enthusiastic, \u201conly think with what eyes we shall observe one another tomorrow, after our tales have been told!\u201d",
            "\u201cBut surely this is a joke, Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked Totski. \u201cYou don\u2019t really mean us to play this game.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhoever is afraid of wolves had better not go into the wood,\u201d said Nastasia, smiling.",
            "\u201cBut, pardon me, Mr. Ferdishenko, is it possible to make a game out of this kind of thing?\u201d persisted Totski, growing more and more uneasy. \u201cI assure you it can\u2019t be a success.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd why not? Why, the last time I simply told straight off about how I stole three roubles.\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps so; but it is hardly possible that you told it so that it seemed like truth, or so that you were believed. And, as Gavrila Ardalionovitch has said, the least suggestion of a falsehood takes all point out of the game. It seems to me that sincerity, on the other hand, is only possible if combined with a kind of bad taste that would be utterly out of place here.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow subtle you are, Afanasy Ivanovitch! You astonish me,\u201d cried Ferdishenko. \u201cYou will remark, gentlemen, that in saying that I could not recount the story of my theft so as to be believed, Afanasy Ivanovitch has very ingeniously implied that I am not capable of thieving\u2014(it would have been bad taste to say so openly); and all the time he is probably firmly convinced, in his own mind, that I am very well capable of it! But now, gentlemen, to business! Put in your slips, ladies and gentlemen\u2014is yours in, Mr. Totski? So\u2014then we are all ready; now prince, draw, please.\u201d The prince silently put his hand into the hat, and drew the names. Ferdishenko was first, then Ptitsin, then the general, Totski next, his own fifth, then Gania, and so on; the ladies did not draw.",
            "\u201cOh, dear! oh, dear!\u201d cried Ferdishenko. \u201cI did so hope the prince would come out first, and then the general. Well, gentlemen, I suppose I must set a good example! What vexes me much is that I am such an insignificant creature that it matters nothing to anybody whether I have done bad actions or not! Besides, which am I to choose? It\u2019s an _embarras de richesse_. Shall I tell how I became a thief on one occasion only, to convince Afanasy Ivanovitch that it is possible to steal without being a thief?\u201d",
            "\u201cDo go on, Ferdishenko, and don\u2019t make unnecessary preface, or you\u2019ll never finish,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna. All observed how irritable and cross she had become since her last burst of laughter; but none the less obstinately did she stick to her absurd whim about this new game. Totski sat looking miserable enough. The general lingered over his champagne, and seemed to be thinking of some story for the time when his turn should come. "

            "\u201cWhat a silly idea,\u201d said the actress. \u201cOf course it is not the case. I have never stolen anything, for one.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! very well, Daria Alexeyevna; you have not stolen anything\u2014agreed. But how about the prince, now\u2014look how he is blushing!\u201d",
            "\u201cI think you are partially right, but you exaggerate,\u201d said the prince, who had certainly blushed up, of a sudden, for some reason or other.",
            "\u201cFerdishenko\u2014either tell us your story, or be quiet, and mind your own business. You exhaust all patience,\u201d cuttingly and irritably remarked Nastasia Philipovna.",
            "\u201cImmediately, immediately! As for my story, gentlemen, it is too stupid and absurd to tell you.",
            "\u201cI assure you I am not a thief, and yet I have stolen; I cannot explain why. It was at Semeon Ivanovitch Ishenka\u2019s country house, one Sunday. He had a dinner party. After dinner the men stayed at the table over their wine. It struck me to ask the daughter of the house to play something on the piano; so I passed through the corner room to join the ladies. In that room, on Maria Ivanovna\u2019s writing-table, I observed a three-rouble note. She must have taken it out for some purpose, and left it lying there. There was no one about. I took up the note and put it in my pocket; why, I can\u2019t say. I don\u2019t know what possessed me to do it, but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining-room and reseated myself at the dinner-table. I sat and waited there in a great state of excitement. I talked hard, and told lots of stories, and laughed like mad; then I joined the ladies.",
            "\u201cIn half an hour or so the loss was discovered, and the servants were being put under examination. Daria, the housemaid was suspected. I exhibited the greatest interest and sympathy, and I remember that poor Daria quite lost her head, and that I began assuring her, before everyone, that I would guarantee her forgiveness on the part of her mistress, if she would confess her guilt. They all stared at the girl, and I remember a wonderful attraction in the reflection that here was I sermonizing away, with the money in my own pocket all the while. I went and spent the three roubles that very evening at a restaurant. I went in and asked for a bottle of Lafite, and drank it up; I wanted to be rid of the money.",
            "\u201cI did not feel much remorse either then or afterwards; but I would not repeat the performance\u2014believe it or not as you please. There\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d",
            "\u201cOnly, of course that\u2019s not nearly your worst action,\u201d said the actress, with evident dislike in her face.",
            "\u201cThat was a psychological phenomenon, not an action,\u201d remarked Totski.",
            "\u201cAnd what about the maid?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna, with undisguised contempt.",
            "\u201cOh, she was turned out next day, of course. It\u2019s a very strict household, there!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you allowed it?\u201d",
            "\u201cI should think so, rather! I was not going to return and confess next day,\u201d laughed Ferdishenko, who seemed a little surprised at the disagreeable impression which his story had made on all parties.",
            "\u201cHow mean you were!\u201d said Nastasia.",
            "\u201cBah! you wish to hear a man tell of his worst actions, and you expect the story to come out goody-goody! One\u2019s worst actions always are mean. We shall see what the general has to say for himself now. All is not gold that glitters, you know; and because a man keeps his carriage he need not be specially virtuous, I assure you, all sorts of people keep carriages. And by what means?\u201d",
            "In a word, Ferdishenko was very angry and rapidly forgetting himself; his whole face was drawn with passion. Strange as it may appear, he had expected much better success for his story. These little errors of taste on Ferdishenko\u2019s part occurred very frequently. Nastasia trembled with rage, and looked fixedly at him, whereupon he relapsed into alarmed silence. He realized that he had gone a little too far.",
            "\u201cHad we not better end this game?\u201d asked Totski.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s my turn, but I plead exemption,\u201d said Ptitsin.",

            "\u201cThen, general, it\u2019s your turn,\u201d continued Nastasia Philipovna, \u201cand if you refuse, the whole game will fall through, which will disappoint me very much, for I was looking forward to relating a certain \u2018page of my own life.\u2019 I am only waiting for you and Afanasy Ivanovitch to have your turns, for I require the support of your example,\u201d she added, smiling.",
            "\u201cOh, if you put it in that way,\u201d cried the general, excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m ready to tell the whole story of my life, but I must confess that I prepared a little story in anticipation of my turn.\u201d",
            "Nastasia smiled amiably at him; but evidently her depression and irritability were increasing with every moment. Totski was dreadfully alarmed to hear her promise a revelation out of her own life.",
            "\u201cI, like everyone else,\u201d began the general, \u201chave committed certain not altogether graceful actions, so to speak, during the course of my life. But the strangest thing of all in my case is, that I should consider the little anecdote which I am now about to give you as a confession of the worst of my \u2018bad actions.\u2019 It is thirty-five years since it all happened, and yet I cannot to this very day recall the circumstances without, as it were, a sudden pang at the heart.",
            "\u201cIt was a silly affair\u2014I was an ensign at the time. You know ensigns\u2014their blood is boiling water, their circumstances generally penurious. Well, I had a servant Nikifor who used to do everything for me in my quarters, economized and managed for me, and even laid hands on anything he could find (belonging to other people), in order to augment our household goods; but a faithful, honest fellow all the same.",
            "\u201cI was strict, but just by nature. At that time we were stationed in a small town. I was quartered at an old widow\u2019s house, a lieutenant\u2019s widow of eighty years of age. She lived in a wretched little wooden house, and had not even a servant, so poor was she.",
            "\u201cHer relations had all died off\u2014her husband was dead and buried forty years since; and a niece, who had lived with her and bullied her up to three years ago, was dead too; so that she was quite alone.",
            "\u201cWell, I was precious dull with her, especially as she was so childish that there was nothing to be got out of her. Eventually, she stole a fowl of mine; the business is a mystery to this day; but it could have been no one but herself. I requested to be quartered somewhere else, and was shifted to the other end of the town, to the house of a merchant with a large family, and a long beard, as I remember him. Nikifor and I were delighted to go; but the old lady was not pleased at our departure.",
            "\u201cWell, a day or two afterwards, when I returned from drill, Nikifor says to me: \u2018We oughtn\u2019t to have left our tureen with the old lady, I\u2019ve nothing to serve the soup in.\u2019",
            "\u201cI asked how it came about that the tureen had been left. Nikifor explained that the old lady refused to give it up, because, she said, we had broken her bowl, and she must have our tureen in place of it; she had declared that I had so arranged the matter with herself.",
            "\u201cThis baseness on her part of course aroused my young blood to fever heat; I jumped up, and away I flew.",
            "\u201cI arrived at the old woman\u2019s house beside myself. She was sitting in a corner all alone, leaning her face on her hand. I fell on her like a clap of thunder. \u2018You old wretch!\u2019 I yelled and all that sort of thing, in real Russian style. Well, when I began cursing at her, a strange thing happened. I looked at her, and she stared back with her eyes starting out of her head, but she did not say a word. She seemed to sway about as she sat, and looked and looked at me in the strangest way. Well, I soon stopped swearing and looked closer at her, asked her questions, but not a word could I get out of her. The flies were buzzing about the room and only this sound broke the silence; the sun was setting outside; I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, so I went away.",
            "\u201cBefore I reached home I was met and summoned to the major\u2019s, so that it was some while before I actually got there. When I came in, Nikifor met me. \u2018Have you heard, sir, that our old lady is dead?\u2019 \u2018_dead_, when?\u2019 \u2018Oh, an hour and a half ago.\u2019 That meant nothing more nor less than that she was dying at the moment when I pounced on her and began abusing her.",
            "\u201cThis produced a great effect upon me. I used to dream of the poor old woman at nights. I really am not superstitious, but two days after, I went to her funeral, and as time went on I thought more and more about her. I said to myself, \u2018This woman, this human being, lived to a great age. She had children, a husband and family, friends and relations; her household was busy and cheerful; she was surrounded by smiling faces; and then suddenly they are gone, and she is left alone like a solitary fly... like a fly, cursed with the burden of her age. At last, God calls her to Himself. At sunset, on a lovely summer\u2019s evening, my little old woman passes away\u2014a thought, you will notice, which offers much food for reflection\u2014and behold! instead of tears and prayers to start her on her last journey, she has insults and jeers from a young ensign, who stands before her with his hands in his pockets, making a terrible row about a soup tureen!\u2019 Of course I was to blame, and even now that I have time to look back at it calmly, I pity the poor old thing no less. I repeat that I wonder at myself, for after all I was not really responsible. Why did she take it into her head to die at that moment? But the more I thought of it, the more I felt the weight of it upon my mind; and I never got quite rid of the impression until I put a couple of old women into an almshouse and kept them there at my own expense. There, that\u2019s all. I repeat I dare say I have committed many a grievous sin in my day; but I cannot help always looking back upon this as the worst action I have ever perpetrated.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! and instead of a bad action, your excellency has detailed one of your noblest deeds,\u201d said Ferdishenko. \u201cFerdishenko is \u2018done.\u2019\u201d",
            "\u201cDear me, general,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna, absently, \u201cI really never imagined you had such a good heart.\u201d",
            "The general laughed with great satisfaction, and applied himself once more to the champagne.",
            "It was now Totski\u2019s turn, and his story was awaited with great curiosity\u2014while all eyes turned on Nastasia Philipovna, as though anticipating that his revelation must be connected somehow with her. Nastasia, during the whole of his story, pulled at the lace trimming of her sleeve, and never once glanced at the speaker. Totski was a handsome man, rather stout, with a very polite and dignified manner. He was always well dressed, and his linen was exquisite. He had plump white hands, and wore a magnificent diamond ring on one finger.",
            "\u201cWhat simplifies the duty before me considerably, in my opinion,\u201d he began, \u201cis that I am bound to recall and relate the very worst action of my life. In such circumstances there can, of course, be no doubt. One\u2019s conscience very soon informs one what is the proper narrative to tell. I admit, that among the many silly and thoughtless actions of my life, the memory of one comes prominently forward and reminds me that it lay long like a stone on my heart. Some twenty years since, I paid a visit to Platon Ordintzeff at his country-house. He had just been elected marshal of the nobility, and had come there with his young wife for the winter holidays. Anfisa Alexeyevna\u2019s birthday came off just then, too, and there were two balls arranged. At that time Dumas-fils\u2019 beautiful work, _La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias_\u2014a novel which I consider imperishable\u2014had just come into fashion. In the provinces all the ladies were in raptures over it, those who had read it, at least. Camellias were all the fashion. Everyone inquired for them, everybody wanted them; and a grand lot of camellias are to be got in a country town\u2014as you all know\u2014and two balls to provide for!",
            "\u201cPoor Peter Volhofskoi was desperately in love with Anfisa Alexeyevna. I don\u2019t know whether there was anything\u2014I mean I don\u2019t know whether he could possibly have indulged in any hope. The poor fellow was beside himself to get her a bouquet of camellias. Countess Sotski and Sophia Bespalova, as everyone knew, were coming with white camellia bouquets. Anfisa wished for red ones, for effect. Well, her husband Platon was driven desperate to find some. And the day before the ball, Anfisa\u2019s rival snapped up the only red camellias to be had in the place, from under Platon\u2019s nose, and Platon\u2014wretched man\u2014was done for. Now if Peter had only been able to step in at this moment with a red bouquet, his little hopes might have made gigantic strides. A woman\u2019s gratitude under such circumstances would have been boundless\u2014but it was practically an impossibility.",
            "\u201cThe night before the ball I met Peter, looking radiant. \u2018What is it?\u2019 I ask. \u2018I\u2019ve found them, Eureka!\u2019 \u2018No! where, where?\u2019 \u2018At Ekshaisk (a little town fifteen miles off) there\u2019s a rich old merchant, who keeps a lot of canaries, has no children, and he and his wife are devoted to flowers. He\u2019s got some camellias.\u2019 \u2018And what if he won\u2019t let you have them?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll go on my knees and implore till I get them. I won\u2019t go away.\u2019 \u2018When shall you start?\u2019 \u2018Tomorrow morning at five o\u2019clock.\u2019 \u2018Go on,\u2019 I said, \u2018and good luck to you.\u2019",
            "\u201cI was glad for the poor fellow, and went home. But an idea got hold of me somehow. I don\u2019t know how. It was nearly two in the morning. I rang the bell and ordered the coachman to be waked up and sent to me. He came. I gave him a tip of fifteen roubles, and told him to get the carriage ready at once. In half an hour it was at the door. I got in and off we went.",
            "\u201cBy five I drew up at the Ekshaisky inn. I waited there till dawn, and soon after six I was off, and at the old merchant Trepalaf\u2019s.",

So up I get, and cut such a bouquet of red camellias! He had a whole greenhouse full of them\u2014lovely ones. The old fellow sighs. I pull out a hundred roubles. \u2018No, no!\u2019 says he, \u2018don\u2019t insult me that way.\u2019 \u2018Oh, if that\u2019s the case, give it to the village hospital,\u2019 I say. \u2018Ah,\u2019 he says, \u2018that\u2019s quite a different matter; that\u2019s good of you and generous. I\u2019ll pay it in there for you with pleasure.\u2019 I liked that old fellow, Russian to the core, _de la vraie souche_. I went home in raptures, but took another road in order to avoid Peter. Immediately on arriving I sent up the bouquet for Anfisa to see when she awoke.",
            "\u201cYou may imagine her ecstasy, her gratitude. The wretched Platon, who had almost died since yesterday of the reproaches showered upon him, wept on my shoulder. Of course poor Peter had no chance after this.",
            "\u201cI thought he would cut my throat at first, and went about armed ready to meet him. But he took it differently; he fainted, and had brain fever and convulsions. A month after, when he had hardly recovered, he went off to the Crimea, and there he was shot.",
            "\u201cI assure you this business left me no peace for many a long year. Why did I do it? I was not in love with her myself; I\u2019m afraid it was simply mischief\u2014pure \u2018cussedness\u2019 on my part.",
            "\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t seized that bouquet from under his nose he might have been alive now, and a happy man. He might have been successful in life, and never have gone to fight the Turks.\u201d",

            "Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s eyes were flashing in a most unmistakable way, now; and her lips were all a-quiver by the time Totski finished his story.",

Isn\u2019t the company good enough for you? And what\u2019s all that about \u2018a game\u2019? I wished to tell my little story, and I told it! Don\u2019t you like it? You heard what I said to the prince? \u2018As you decide, so it shall be!\u2019 If he had said \u2018yes,\u2019 I should have given my consent! But he said \u2018no,\u2019 so I refused.

Nine years and three months\u2019 captivity is enough for anybody. Tomorrow I shall start afresh\u2014today I am a free agent for the first time in my life.",

Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your presence? I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it cannot be helped\u2014and I should be very grateful if you could all stay and witness this climax. However, just as you please, of course.\u201d",
            "The guests exchanged glances; they were annoyed and bewildered by the episode; but it was clear enough that all this had been pre-arranged and expected by Nastasia Philipovna, and that there was no use in trying to stop her now\u2014for she was little short of insane.",
            "Besides, they were naturally inquisitive to see what was to happen. There was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm. There were but two ladies present; one of whom was the lively actress, who was not easily frightened, and the other the silent German beauty who, it turned out, did not understand a word of Russian, and seemed to be as stupid as she was lovely.",
            "Her acquaintances invited her to their \u201cAt Homes\u201d because she was so decorative. She was exhibited to their guests like a valuable picture, or vase, or statue, or firescreen. As for the men, Ptitsin was one of Rogojin\u2019s friends; Ferdishenko was as much at home as a fish in the sea, Gania, not yet recovered from his amazement, appeared to be chained to a pillory. The old professor did not in the least understand what was happening; but when he noticed how extremely agitated the mistress of the house, and her friends, seemed, he nearly wept, and trembled with fright: but he would rather have died than leave Nastasia Philipovna at such a crisis, for he loved her as if she were his own granddaughter. Afanasy Ivanovitch greatly disliked having anything to do with the affair, but he was too much interested to leave, in spite of the mad turn things had taken; and a few words that had dropped from the lips of Nastasia puzzled him so much, that he felt he could not go without an explanation. He resolved therefore, to see it out, and to adopt the attitude of silent spectator, as most suited to his dignity. General Epanchin alone determined to depart. He was annoyed at the manner in which his gift had been returned, as though he had condescended, under the influence of passion, to place himself on a level with Ptitsin and Ferdishenko, his self-respect and sense of duty now returned together with a consciousness of what was due to his social rank and official importance. In short, he plainly showed his conviction that a man in his position could have nothing to do with Rogojin and his companions. But Nastasia interrupted him at his first words.",
            "\u201cAh, general!\u201d she cried, \u201cI was forgetting! If I had only foreseen this unpleasantness! I won\u2019t insist on keeping you against your will, although I should have liked you to be beside me now. In any case, I am most grateful to you for your visit, and flattering attention... but if you are afraid...\u201d",

I have remained until now simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger, I am only afraid that the carpets may be ruined, and the furniture smashed!... You should shut the door on the lot, in my opinion. But I confess that I am extremely curious to see how it ends.\u201d",
            "\u201cRogojin!\u201d announced Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cWhat do you think about it?\u201d said the general in a low voice to Totski. \u201cIs she mad? I mean mad in the medical sense of the word .... eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve always said she was predisposed to it,\u201d whispered Afanasy Ivanovitch slyly. \u201cPerhaps it is a fever!\u201d",
            "Since their visit to Gania\u2019s home, Rogojin\u2019s followers had been increased by two new recruits\u2014a dissolute old man, the hero of some ancient scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant. A laughable story was told of the former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth, and one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them, and was never able to reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival of the gentleman who was so proud of his fists. He was known to none of Rogojin\u2019s followers, but as they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood begging, he had joined their ranks. His claim for the charity he desired seemed based on the fact that in the days of his prosperity he had given away as much as fifteen roubles at a time. The rivals seemed more than a little jealous of one another. The athlete appeared injured at the admission of the \u201cbeggar\u201d into the company. By nature taciturn, he now merely growled occasionally like a bear, and glared contemptuously upon the \u201cbeggar,\u201d who, being somewhat of a man of the world, and a diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the bear\u2019s good graces. He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and doubtless was conscious that he must tread warily. Gently and without argument he alluded to the advantages of the English style in boxing, and showed himself a firm believer in Western institutions. The athlete\u2019s lips curled disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal denial, he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian object\u2014an enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red hairs! The sight of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to convince anybody, without words, that it was a serious matter for those who should happen to come into contact with it.",
            "None of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended visit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent his followers from drinking too much. He was sober himself, but the excitement of this chaotic day\u2014the strangest day of his life\u2014had affected him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost resembled drunkenness.",
            "He had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked in an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense. His lieutenants had worked so hard from five o\u2019clock until eleven, that they actually had collected a hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific expense, that the rate of interest was only mentioned among them in whispers and with bated breath.",
            "As before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him with mingled self-assertion and timidity. They were specially frightened of Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason.",
            "Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further ceremony, the elegant and irresistible Zaleshoff among them. But the party led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile intentions, silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia Philipovna, and marched into her house as they would have marched into an enemy\u2019s fortress. Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to inspire them with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm. So many things were entirely new to their experience\u2014the choice furniture, the pictures, the great statue of Venus. They followed their chief into the salon, however, with a kind of impudent curiosity. There, the sight of General Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty retreat into the adjoining room, the \u201cboxer\u201d and \u201cbeggar\u201d being among the first to go. A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their ground; he had contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he quite understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million odd roubles, and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his hand. It may be added that the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff, had the vaguest idea of the extent of their powers, and of how far they could safely go. At some moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on their side; at others he tried uneasily to remember various cheering and reassuring articles of the Civil Code.",
            "Rogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon Nastasia, stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it was clear that his heart was beating painfully. So he stood, gazing intently, but timidly, for a few seconds. Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table. On his way he collided against Ptitsin\u2019s chair, and put his dirty foot on the lace skirt of the silent lady\u2019s dress; but he neither apologized for this, nor even noticed it.",
            "On reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object, which he had carried with him into the drawing-room. This was a paper packet, some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length, wrapped in an old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with string.",
            "Having placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as though awaiting his sentence.",
            "His costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a new silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened with a huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty forefinger.",
            "Lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the band waited about near the door.",
            "The two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at this unusual and disorderly scene.",
            "\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin, and indicating the paper packet.",
            "\u201cA hundred thousand,\u201d replied the latter, almost in a whisper.",
            "\u201cOh! so he kept his word\u2014there\u2019s a man for you! Well, sit down, please\u2014take that chair. I shall have something to say to you presently. Who are all these with you? The same party? Let them come in and sit down. There\u2019s room on that sofa, there are some chairs and there\u2019s another sofa! Well, why don\u2019t they sit down?\u201d",
            "Sure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at this point, and retreated into the next room. Others, however, took the hint and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however; feeling braver in proportion to their distance from Nastasia.",
            "Rogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon stood up again, and did not reseat himself. Little by little he began to look around him and discern the other guests. Seeing Gania, he smiled venomously and muttered to himself, \u201cLook at that!\u201d",
            "He gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with very little curiosity. But when he observed that the prince was seated beside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for a long while, and was clearly amazed. He could not account for the prince\u2019s presence there. It was not in the least surprising that Rogojin should be, at this time, in a more or less delirious condition; for not to speak of the excitements of the day, he had spent the night before in the train, and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight hours.",
            "\u201cThis, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna, addressing the company in general, \u201chere, in this dirty parcel. This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would bring me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for him all the while. He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered me eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred thousand. And he has kept his word, see! My goodness, how white he is! All this happened this afternoon, at Gania\u2019s. I had gone to pay his mother a visit\u2014my future family, you know! And his sister said to my very face, surely somebody will turn this shameless creature out. After which she spat in her brother Gania\u2019s face\u2014a girl of character, that!\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d began the general, reproachfully. He was beginning to put his own interpretation on the affair.",
            "\u201cWell, what, general? Not quite good form, eh? Oh, nonsense! Here have I been sitting in my box at the French theatre for the last five years like a statue of inaccessible virtue, and kept out of the way of all admirers, like a silly little idiot! Now, there\u2019s this man, who comes and pays down his hundred thousand on the table, before you all, in spite of my five years of innocence and proud virtue, and I dare be sworn he has his sledge outside waiting to carry me off. He values me at a hundred thousand! I see you are still angry with me, Gania! Why, surely you never really wished to take _me_ into your family? _me_, Rogojin\u2019s mistress! What did the prince say just now?\u201d",
            "\u201cI never said you were Rogojin\u2019s mistress\u2014you are _not!_\u201d said the prince, in trembling accents.",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna, dear soul!\u201d cried the actress, impatiently, \u201cdo be calm, dear! If it annoys you so\u2014all this\u2014do go away and rest! Of course you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his hundred thousand roubles! Take his money and kick him out of the house; that\u2019s the way to treat him and the likes of him! Upon my word, if it were my business, I\u2019d soon clear them all out!\u201d",
            "The actress was a kind-hearted woman, and highly impressionable. She was very angry now.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t be cross, Daria Alexeyevna!\u201d laughed Nastasia. \u201cI was not angry when I spoke; I wasn\u2019t reproaching Gania. I don\u2019t know how it was that I ever could have indulged the whim of entering an honest family like his. I saw his mother\u2014and kissed her hand, too. I came and stirred up all that fuss, Gania, this afternoon, on purpose to see how much you could swallow\u2014you surprised me, my friend\u2014you did, indeed. Surely you could not marry a woman who accepts pearls like those you knew the general was going to give me, on the very eve of her marriage? And Rogojin! Why, in your own house and before your own brother and sister, he bargained with me! Yet you could come here and expect to be betrothed to me before you left the house! You almost brought your sister, too. Surely what Rogojin said about you is not really true: that you would crawl all the way to the other end of the town, on hands and knees, for three roubles?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, he would!\u201d said Rogojin, quietly, but with an air of absolute conviction.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! and he receives a good salary, I\u2019m told. Well, what should you get but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your family (for I know very well that you do hate me)? No, no! I believe now that a man like you would murder anyone for money\u2014sharpen a razor and come up behind his best friend and cut his throat like a sheep\u2014I\u2019ve read of such people. Everyone seems money-mad nowadays. No, no! I may be shameless, but you are far worse. I don\u2019t say a word about that other\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna, is this really you? You, once so refined and delicate of speech. Oh, what a tongue! What dreadful things you are saying,\u201d cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief.",
            "\u201cI am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you know\u2014it\u2019s my birthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias, sitting there laughing at us?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my attention,\u201d said Totski, with dignity.",
            "\u201cWell, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free? Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to be\u2014nothing particular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept me like a countess. Money\u2014my word! What a lot of money he spent over me! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this Gania, here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live with him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite justified.",
            "\u201cYou say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true, it is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long ago, not Gania\u2014Oh, no!\u2014but that would have been abominable too.",
            "\u201cWould you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four years ago! I meant mischief, I confess\u2014but I could have had him, I give you my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! it\u2019s not worthwhile to take such advantage of him. No! I had better go on to the streets, or accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something\u2014for I have nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything behind, to the last rag\u2014he shall have it all back. And who would take me without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even Ferdishenko wouldn\u2019t have me!\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d said that worthy. \u201cBut the prince would. You sit here making complaints, but just look at the prince. I\u2019ve been observing him for a long while.\u201d",
            "Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince.",
            "\u201cIs that true?\u201d she asked.",
            "\u201cQuite true,\u201d whispered the prince.",
            "\u201cYou\u2019ll take me as I am, with nothing?\u201d",

            "\u201cHere\u2019s a pretty business!\u201d cried the general. \u201cHowever, it might have been expected of him.\u201d",
            "The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and piercing, gaze.",
            "\u201cHere\u2019s another alternative for me,\u201d said Nastasia, turning once more to the actress; \u201cand he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know him. I\u2019ve found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be true\u2014that he\u2019s an\u2014we know what. And what shall you live on, if you are really so madly in love with Rogojin\u2019s mistress, that you are ready to marry her\u2014eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cI take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovna\u2014not as Rogojin\u2019s mistress.\u201d",
            "\u201cWho? I?\u2014good and honest?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, you.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, you get those ideas out of novels, you know. Times are changed now, dear prince; the world sees things as they really are. That\u2019s all nonsense. Besides, how can you marry? You need a nurse, not a wife.\u201d",
            "The prince rose and began to speak in a trembling, timid tone, but with the air of a man absolutely sure of the truth of his words.",
            "\u201cI know nothing, Nastasia Philipovna. I have seen nothing. You are right so far; but I consider that you would be honouring me, and not I you. I am a nobody. You have suffered, you have passed through hell and emerged pure, and that is very much. Why do you shame yourself by desiring to go with Rogojin? You are delirious. You have returned to Mr. Totski his seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you will leave this house and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct that not one person here would imitate. Nastasia Philipovna, I love you! I would die for you. I shall never let any man say one word against you, Nastasia Philipovna! and if we are poor, I can work for both.\u201d",
            "As the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from Ferdishenko; Lebedeff laughed too. The general grunted with irritation; Ptitsin and Totski barely restrained their smiles. The rest all sat listening, open-mouthed with wonder.",
            "\u201cBut perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones. \u201cI don\u2019t know for certain, and I\u2019m sorry to say I haven\u2019t had an opportunity of finding out all day; but I received a letter from Moscow, while I was in Switzerland, from a Mr. Salaskin, and he acquaints me with the fact that I am entitled to a very large inheritance. This letter\u2014\u201d",
            "The prince pulled a letter out of his pocket.",
            "\u201cIs he raving?\u201d said the general. \u201cAre we really in a mad-house?\u201d",
            "There was silence for a moment. Then Ptitsin spoke.",
            "\u201cI think you said, prince, that your letter was from Salaskin? Salaskin is a very eminent man, indeed, in his own world; he is a wonderfully clever solicitor, and if he really tells you this, I think you may be pretty sure that he is right. It so happens, luckily, that I know his handwriting, for I have lately had business with him. If you would allow me to see it, I should perhaps be able to tell you.\u201d",
            "The prince held out the letter silently, but with a shaking hand.",
            "\u201cWhat, what?\u201d said the general, much agitated.",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s all this? Is he really heir to anything?\u201d",
            "All present concentrated their attention upon Ptitsin, reading the prince\u2019s letter. The general curiosity had received a new fillip. Ferdishenko could not sit still. Rogojin fixed his eyes first on the prince, and then on Ptitsin, and then back again; he was extremely agitated. Lebedeff could not stand it. He crept up and read over Ptitsin\u2019s shoulder, with the air of a naughty boy who expects a box on the ear every moment for his indiscretion. "

        "XVI.": [
            "\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried the general, starting up as if he had been shot.",
            "Ptitsin explained, for the benefit of the company, that the prince\u2019s aunt had died five months since. He had never known her, but she was his mother\u2019s own sister, the daughter of a Moscow merchant, one Paparchin, who had died a bankrupt. But the elder brother of this same Paparchin, had been an eminent and very rich merchant. A year since it had so happened that his only two sons had both died within the same month. This sad event had so affected the old man that he, too, had died very shortly after. He was a widower, and had no relations left, excepting the prince\u2019s aunt, a poor woman living on charity, who was herself at the point of death from dropsy; but who had time, before she died, to set Salaskin to work to find her nephew, and to make her will bequeathing her newly-acquired fortune to him.",
            "It appeared that neither the prince, nor the doctor with whom he lived in Switzerland, had thought of waiting for further communications; but the prince had started straight away with Salaskin\u2019s letter in his pocket.",
            "\u201cOne thing I may tell you, for certain,\u201d concluded Ptitsin, addressing the prince, \u201cthat there is no question about the authenticity of this matter. Anything that Salaskin writes you as regards your unquestionable right to this inheritance, you may look upon as so much money in your pocket. I congratulate you, prince; you may receive a million and a half of roubles, perhaps more; I don\u2019t know. All I _do_ know is that Paparchin was a very rich merchant indeed.\u201d",
            "\u201cHurrah!\u201d cried Lebedeff, in a drunken voice. \u201cHurrah for the last of the Muishkins!\u201d",
            "\u201cMy goodness me! and I gave him twenty-five roubles this morning as though he were a beggar,\u201d blurted out the general, half senseless with amazement. \u201cWell, I congratulate you, I congratulate you!\u201d And the general rose from his seat and solemnly embraced the prince. All came forward with congratulations; even those of Rogojin\u2019s party who had retreated into the next room, now crept softly back to look on. For the moment even Nastasia Philipovna was forgotten.",
            "But gradually the consciousness crept back into the minds of each one present that the prince had just made her an offer of marriage. The situation had, therefore, become three times as fantastic as before.",
            "Totski sat and shrugged his shoulders, bewildered. He was the only guest left sitting at this time; the others had thronged round the table in disorder, and were all talking at once.",
            "It was generally agreed, afterwards, in recalling that evening, that from this moment Nastasia Philipovna seemed entirely to lose her senses. She continued to sit still in her place, looking around at her guests with a strange, bewildered expression, as though she were trying to collect her thoughts, and could not. Then she suddenly turned to the prince, and glared at him with frowning brows; but this only lasted one moment. Perhaps it suddenly struck her that all this was a jest, but his face seemed to reassure her. She reflected, and smiled again, vaguely.",
            "\u201cSo I am really a princess,\u201d she whispered to herself, ironically, and glancing accidentally at Daria Alexeyevna\u2019s face, she burst out laughing.",
            "\u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d she cried, \u201cthis is an unexpected climax, after all. I didn\u2019t expect this. What are you all standing up for, gentlemen? Sit down; congratulate me and the prince! Ferdishenko, just step out and order some more champagne, will you? Katia, Pasha,\u201d she added suddenly, seeing the servants at the door, \u201ccome here! I\u2019m going to be married, did you hear? To the prince. He has a million and a half of roubles; he is Prince Muishkin, and has asked me to marry him. Here, prince, come and sit by me; and here comes the wine. Now then, ladies and gentlemen, where are your congratulations?\u201d",
            "\u201cHurrah!\u201d cried a number of voices. A rush was made for the wine by Rogojin\u2019s followers, though, even among them, there seemed some sort of realization that the situation had changed. Rogojin stood and looked on, with an incredulous smile, screwing up one side of his mouth.",
            "\u201cPrince, my dear fellow, do remember what you are about,\u201d said the general, approaching Muishkin, and pulling him by the coat sleeve.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna overheard the remark, and burst out laughing.",
            "\u201cNo, no, general!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou had better look out! I am the princess now, you know. The prince won\u2019t let you insult me. Afanasy Ivanovitch, why don\u2019t you congratulate me? I shall be able to sit at table with your new wife, now. Aha! you see what I gain by marrying a prince! A million and a half, and a prince, and an idiot into the bargain, they say. What better could I wish for? Life is only just about to commence for me in earnest. Rogojin, you are a little too late. Away with your paper parcel! I\u2019m going to marry the prince; I\u2019m richer than you are now.\u201d",
            "But Rogojin understood how things were tending, at last. An inexpressibly painful expression came over his face. He wrung his hands; a groan made its way up from the depths of his soul.",
            "\u201cSurrender her, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d he said to the prince.",
            "All around burst out laughing.",
            "\u201cWhat? Surrender her to _you?_\u201d cried Daria Alexeyevna. \u201cTo a fellow who comes and bargains for a wife like a moujik! The prince wishes to marry her, and you\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cSo do I, so do I! This moment, if I could! I\u2019d give every farthing I have to do it.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou drunken moujik,\u201d said Daria Alexeyevna, once more. \u201cYou ought to be kicked out of the place.\u201d",
            "The laughter became louder than ever.",
            "\u201cDo you hear, prince?\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cDo you hear how this moujik of a fellow goes on bargaining for your bride?\u201d",
            "\u201cHe is drunk,\u201d said the prince, quietly, \u201cand he loves you very much.\u201d",
            "\u201cWon\u2019t you be ashamed, afterwards, to reflect that your wife very nearly ran away with Rogojin?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, you were raving, you were in a fever; you are still half delirious.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd won\u2019t you be ashamed when they tell you, afterwards, that your wife lived at Totski\u2019s expense so many years?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo; I shall not be ashamed of that. You did not so live by your own will.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you\u2019ll never reproach me with it?\u201d",
            "\u201cNever.\u201d",
            "\u201cTake care, don\u2019t commit yourself for a whole lifetime.\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna.\u201d said the prince, quietly, and with deep emotion, \u201cI said before that I shall esteem your consent to be my wife as a great honour to myself, and shall consider that it is you who will honour me, not I you, by our marriage. You laughed at these words, and others around us laughed as well; I heard them. Very likely I expressed myself funnily, and I may have looked funny, but, for all that, I believe I understand where honour lies, and what I said was but the literal truth. You were about to ruin yourself just now, irrevocably; you would never have forgiven yourself for so doing afterwards; and yet, you are absolutely blameless. It is impossible that your life should be altogether ruined at your age. What matter that Rogojin came bargaining here, and that Gavrila Ardalionovitch would have deceived you if he could? Why do you continually remind us of these facts? I assure you once more that very few could find it in them to act as you have acted this day. As for your wish to go with Rogojin, that was simply the idea of a delirious and suffering brain. You are still quite feverish; you ought to be in bed, not here. You know quite well that if you had gone with Rogojin, you would have become a washer-woman next day, rather than stay with him. You are proud, Nastasia Philipovna, and perhaps you have really suffered so much that you imagine yourself to be a desperately guilty woman. You require a great deal of petting and looking after, Nastasia Philipovna, and I will do this. I saw your portrait this morning, and it seemed quite a familiar face to me; it seemed to me that the portrait-face was calling to me for help. I\u2014I shall respect you all my life, Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d concluded the prince, as though suddenly recollecting himself, and blushing to think of the sort of company before whom he had said all this.",
            "Ptitsin bowed his head and looked at the ground, overcome by a mixture of feelings. Totski muttered to himself: \u201cHe may be an idiot, but he knows that flattery is the best road to success here.\u201d",
            "The prince observed Gania\u2019s eyes flashing at him, as though they would gladly annihilate him then and there.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a kind-hearted man, if you like,\u201d said Daria Alexeyevna, whose wrath was quickly evaporating.",
            "\u201cA refined man, but\u2014lost,\u201d murmured the general.",
            "Totski took his hat and rose to go. He and the general exchanged glances, making a private arrangement, thereby, to leave the house together.",
            "\u201cThank you, prince; no one has ever spoken to me like that before,\u201d began Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cMen have always bargained for me, before this; and not a single respectable man has ever proposed to marry me. Do you hear, Afanasy Ivanovitch? What do _you_ think of what the prince has just been saying? It was almost immodest, wasn\u2019t it? You, Rogojin, wait a moment, don\u2019t go yet! I see you don\u2019t intend to move however. Perhaps I may go with you yet. Where did you mean to take me to?\u201d",
            "\u201cTo Ekaterinhof,\u201d replied Lebedeff. Rogojin simply stood staring, with trembling lips, not daring to believe his ears. He was stunned, as though from a blow on the head.",
            "\u201cWhat are you thinking of, my dear Nastasia?\u201d said Daria Alexeyevna in alarm. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d \u201cYou are not going mad, are you?\u201d",
            "Nastasia Philipovna burst out laughing and jumped up from the sofa.",
            "\u201cYou thought I should accept this good child\u2019s invitation to ruin him, did you?\u201d she cried. \u201cThat\u2019s Totski\u2019s way, not mine. He\u2019s fond of children. Come along, Rogojin, get your money ready! We won\u2019t talk about marrying just at this moment, but let\u2019s see the money at all events. Come! I may not marry you, either. I don\u2019t know. I suppose you thought you\u2019d keep the money, if I did! Ha, ha, ha! nonsense! I have no sense of shame left. I tell you I have been Totski\u2019s concubine. Prince, you must marry Aglaya Ivanovna, not Nastasia Philipovna, or this fellow Ferdishenko will always be pointing the finger of scorn at you. You aren\u2019t afraid, I know; but I should always be afraid that I had ruined you, and that you would reproach me for it. As for what you say about my doing you honour by marrying you\u2014well, Totski can tell you all about that. You had your eye on Aglaya, Gania, you know you had; and you might have married her if you had not come bargaining. You are all like this. You should choose, once for all, between disreputable women, and respectable ones, or you are sure to get mixed. Look at the general, how he\u2019s staring at me!\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is too horrible,\u201d said the general, starting to his feet. All were standing up now. Nastasia was absolutely beside herself.",
            "\u201cI am very proud, in spite of what I am,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou called me \u2018perfection\u2019 just now, prince. A nice sort of perfection to throw up a prince and a million and a half of roubles in order to be able to boast of the fact afterwards! What sort of a wife should I make for you, after all I have said? Afanasy Ivanovitch, do you observe I have really and truly thrown away a million of roubles? And you thought that I should consider your wretched seventy-five thousand, with Gania thrown in for a husband, a paradise of bliss! Take your seventy-five thousand back, sir; you did not reach the hundred thousand. Rogojin cut a better dash than you did. I\u2019ll console Gania myself; I have an idea about that. But now I must be off! I\u2019ve been in prison for ten years. I\u2019m free at last! Well, Rogojin, what are you waiting for? Let\u2019s get ready and go.\u201d",
            "\u201cCome along!\u201d shouted Rogojin, beside himself with joy. \u201cHey! all of you fellows! Wine! Round with it! Fill the glasses!\u201d",
            "\u201cGet away!\u201d he shouted frantically, observing that Daria Alexeyevna was approaching to protest against Nastasia\u2019s conduct. \u201cGet away, she\u2019s mine, everything\u2019s mine! She\u2019s a queen, get away!\u201d",
            "He was panting with ecstasy. He walked round and round Nastasia Philipovna and told everybody to \u201ckeep their distance.\u201d",
            "All the Rogojin company were now collected in the drawing-room; some were drinking, some laughed and talked: all were in the highest and wildest spirits. Ferdishenko was doing his best to unite himself to them; the general and Totski again made an attempt to go. Gania, too stood hat in hand ready to go; but seemed to be unable to tear his eyes away from the scene before him.",
            "\u201cGet out, keep your distance!\u201d shouted Rogojin.",
            "\u201cWhat are you shouting about there!\u201d cried Nastasia \u201cI\u2019m not yours yet. I may kick you out for all you know I haven\u2019t taken your money yet; there it all is on the table. Here, give me over that packet! Is there a hundred thousand roubles in that one packet? Pfu! what abominable stuff it looks! Oh! nonsense, Daria Alexeyevna; you surely did not expect me to ruin _him?_\u201d (indicating the prince). \u201cFancy him nursing me! Why, he needs a nurse himself! The general, there, will be his nurse now, you\u2019ll see. Here, prince, look here! Your bride is accepting money. What a disreputable woman she must be! And you wished to marry her! What are you crying about? Is it a bitter dose? Never mind, you shall laugh yet. Trust to time.\u201d (In spite of these words there were two large tears rolling down Nastasia\u2019s own cheeks.) \u201cIt\u2019s far better to think twice of it now than afterwards. Oh! you mustn\u2019t cry like that! There\u2019s Katia crying, too. What is it, Katia, dear? I shall leave you and Pasha a lot of things, I\u2019ve laid them out for you already; but good-bye, now. I made an honest girl like you serve a low woman like myself. It\u2019s better so, prince, it is indeed. You\u2019d begin to despise me afterwards\u2014we should never be happy. Oh! you needn\u2019t swear, prince, I shan\u2019t believe you, you know. How foolish it would be, too! No, no; we\u2019d better say good-bye and part friends. I am a bit of a dreamer myself, and I used to dream of you once. Very often during those five years down at his estate I used to dream and think, and I always imagined just such a good, honest, foolish fellow as you, one who should come and say to me: \u2018You are an innocent woman, Nastasia Philipovna, and I adore you.\u2019 I dreamt of you often. I used to think so much down there that I nearly went mad; and then this fellow here would come down. He would stay a couple of months out of the twelve, and disgrace and insult and deprave me, and then go; so that I longed to drown myself in the pond a thousand times over; but I did not dare do it. I hadn\u2019t the heart, and now\u2014well, are you ready, Rogojin?\u201d",
            "\u201cReady\u2014keep your distance, all of you!\u201d",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re all ready,\u201d said several of his friends. \u201cThe troikas [Sledges drawn by three horses abreast.] are at the door, bells and all.\u201d",
            "Nastasia Philipovna seized the packet of bank-notes.",
            "\u201cGania, I have an idea. I wish to recompense you\u2014why should you lose all? Rogojin, would he crawl for three roubles as far as the Vassiliostrof?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, wouldn\u2019t he just!\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, look here, Gania. I wish to look into your heart once more, for the last time. You\u2019ve worried me for the last three months\u2014now it\u2019s my turn. Do you see this packet? It contains a hundred thousand roubles. Now, I\u2019m going to throw it into the fire, here\u2014before all these witnesses. As soon as the fire catches hold of it, you put your hands into the fire and pick it out\u2014without gloves, you know. You must have bare hands, and you must turn your sleeves up. Pull it out, I say, and it\u2019s all yours. You may burn your fingers a little, of course; but then it\u2019s a hundred thousand roubles, remember\u2014it won\u2019t take you long to lay hold of it and snatch it out. I shall so much admire you if you put your hands into the fire for my money. All here present may be witnesses that the whole packet of money is yours if you get it out. If you don\u2019t get it out, it shall burn. I will let no one else come; away\u2014get away, all of you\u2014it\u2019s my money! Rogojin has bought me with it. Is it my money, Rogojin?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, my queen; it\u2019s your own money, my joy.\u201d",
            "\u201cGet away then, all of you. I shall do as I like with my own\u2014don\u2019t meddle! Ferdishenko, make up the fire, quick!\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna, I can\u2019t; my hands won\u2019t obey me,\u201d said Ferdishenko, astounded and helpless with bewilderment.",
            "\u201cNonsense,\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna, seizing the poker and raking a couple of logs together. No sooner did a tongue of flame burst out than she threw the packet of notes upon it.",
            "Everyone gasped; some even crossed themselves.",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s mad\u2014she\u2019s mad!\u201d was the cry.",
            "\u201cOughtn\u2019t-oughtn\u2019t we to secure her?\u201d asked the general of Ptitsin, in a whisper; \u201cor shall we send for the authorities? Why, she\u2019s mad, isn\u2019t she\u2014isn\u2019t she, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cN-no, I hardly think she is actually mad,\u201d whispered Ptitsin, who was as white as his handkerchief, and trembling like a leaf. He could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet.",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s mad surely, isn\u2019t she?\u201d the general appealed to Totski.",
            "\u201cI told you she wasn\u2019t an ordinary woman,\u201d replied the latter, who was as pale as anyone.",
            "\u201cOh, but, positively, you know\u2014a hundred thousand roubles!\u201d",
            "\u201cGoodness gracious! good heavens!\u201d came from all quarters of the room.",
            "All now crowded round the fire and thronged to see what was going on; everyone lamented and gave vent to exclamations of horror and woe. Some jumped up on chairs in order to get a better view. Daria Alexeyevna ran into the next room and whispered excitedly to Katia and Pasha. The beautiful German disappeared altogether.",
            "\u201cMy lady! my sovereign!\u201d lamented Lebedeff, falling on his knees before Nastasia Philipovna, and stretching out his hands towards the fire; \u201cit\u2019s a hundred thousand roubles, it is indeed, I packed it up myself, I saw the money! My queen, let me get into the fire after it\u2014say the word\u2014I\u2019ll put my whole grey head into the fire for it! I have a poor lame wife and thirteen children. My father died of starvation last week. Nastasia Philipovna, Nastasia Philipovna!\u201d The wretched little man wept, and groaned, and crawled towards the fire.",
            "\u201cAway, out of the way!\u201d cried Nastasia. \u201cMake room, all of you! Gania, what are you standing there for? Don\u2019t stand on ceremony. Put in your hand! There\u2019s your whole happiness smouldering away, look! Quick!\u201d",
            "But Gania had borne too much that day, and especially this evening, and he was not prepared for this last, quite unexpected trial.",
            "The crowd parted on each side of him and he was left face to face with Nastasia Philipovna, three paces from her. She stood by the fire and waited, with her intent gaze fixed upon him.",
            "Gania stood before her, in his evening clothes, holding his white gloves and hat in his hand, speechless and motionless, with arms folded and eyes fixed on the fire.",
            "A silly, meaningless smile played on his white, death-like lips. He could not take his eyes off the smouldering packet; but it appeared that something new had come to birth in his soul\u2014as though he were vowing to himself that he would bear this trial. He did not move from his place. In a few seconds it became evident to all that he did not intend to rescue the money.",
            "\u201cHey! look at it, it\u2019ll burn in another minute or two!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cYou\u2019ll hang yourself afterwards, you know, if it does! I\u2019m not joking.\u201d",
            "The fire, choked between a couple of smouldering pieces of wood, had died down for the first few moments after the packet was thrown upon it. But a little tongue of fire now began to lick the paper from below, and soon, gathering courage, mounted the sides of the parcel, and crept around it. In another moment, the whole of it burst into flames, and the exclamations of woe and horror were redoubled.",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d lamented Lebedeff again, straining towards the fireplace; but Rogojin dragged him away, and pushed him to the rear once more.",
            "The whole of Rogojin\u2019s being was concentrated in one rapturous gaze of ecstasy. He could not take his eyes off Nastasia. He stood drinking her in, as it were. He was in the seventh heaven of delight.",
            "\u201cOh, what a queen she is!\u201d he ejaculated, every other minute, throwing out the remark for anyone who liked to catch it. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of woman for me! Which of you would think of doing a thing like that, you blackguards, eh?\u201d he yelled. He was hopelessly and wildly beside himself with ecstasy.",
            "The prince watched the whole scene, silent and dejected.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll pull it out with my teeth for one thousand,\u201d said Ferdishenko.",
            "\u201cSo would I,\u201d said another, from behind, \u201cwith pleasure. Devil take the thing!\u201d he added, in a tempest of despair, \u201cit will all be burnt up in a minute\u2014It\u2019s burning, it\u2019s burning!\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s burning, it\u2019s burning!\u201d cried all, thronging nearer and nearer to the fire in their excitement.",
            "\u201cGania, don\u2019t be a fool! I tell you for the last time.\u201d",
            "\u201cGet on, quick!\u201d shrieked Ferdishenko, rushing wildly up to Gania, and trying to drag him to the fire by the sleeve of his coat. \u201cGet it, you dummy, it\u2019s burning away fast! Oh\u2014_damn_ the thing!\u201d",
            "Gania hurled Ferdishenko from him; then he turned sharp round and made for the door. But he had not gone a couple of steps when he tottered and fell to the ground.",
            "\u201cHe\u2019s fainted!\u201d the cry went round.",
            "\u201cAnd the money\u2019s burning still,\u201d Lebedeff lamented.",
            "\u201cBurning for nothing,\u201d shouted others.",
            "\u201cKatia-Pasha! Bring him some water!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. Then she took the tongs and fished out the packet.",
            "Nearly the whole of the outer covering was burned away, but it was soon evident that the contents were hardly touched. The packet had been wrapped in a threefold covering of newspaper, and the notes were safe. All breathed more freely.",
            "\u201cSome dirty little thousand or so may be touched,\u201d said Lebedeff, immensely relieved, \u201cbut there\u2019s very little harm done, after all.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s all his\u2014the whole packet is for him, do you hear\u2014all of you?\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna, placing the packet by the side of Gania. \u201cHe restrained himself, and didn\u2019t go after it; so his self-respect is greater than his thirst for money. All right\u2014he\u2019ll come to directly\u2014he must have the packet or he\u2019ll cut his throat afterwards. There! He\u2019s coming to himself. General, Totski, all of you, did you hear me? The money is all Gania\u2019s. I give it to him, fully conscious of my action, as recompense for\u2014well, for anything he thinks best. Tell him so. Let it lie here beside him. Off we go, Rogojin! Goodbye, prince. I have seen a man for the first time in my life. Goodbye, Afanasy Ivanovitch\u2014and thanks!\u201d",
            "The Rogojin gang followed their leader and Nastasia Philipovna to the entrance-hall, laughing and shouting and whistling.",
            "In the hall the servants were waiting, and handed her her fur cloak. Martha, the cook, ran in from the kitchen. Nastasia kissed them all round.",
            "\u201cAre you really throwing us all over, little mother? Where, where are you going to? And on your birthday, too!\u201d cried the four girls, crying over her and kissing her hands.",
            "\u201cI am going out into the world, Katia; perhaps I shall be a laundress. I don\u2019t know. No more of Afanasy Ivanovitch, anyhow. Give him my respects. Don\u2019t think badly of me, girls.\u201d",
            "The prince hurried down to the front gate where the party were settling into the troikas, all the bells tinkling a merry accompaniment the while. The general caught him up on the stairs:",
            "\u201cPrince, prince!\u201d he cried, seizing hold of his arm, \u201crecollect yourself! Drop her, prince! You see what sort of a woman she is. I am speaking to you like a father.\u201d",
            "The prince glanced at him, but said nothing. He shook himself free, and rushed on downstairs.",
            "The general was just in time to see the prince take the first sledge he could get, and, giving the order to Ekaterinhof, start off in pursuit of the troikas. Then the general\u2019s fine grey horse dragged that worthy home, with some new thoughts, and some new hopes and calculations developing in his brain, and with the pearls in his pocket, for he had not forgotten to bring them along with him, being a man of business. Amid his new thoughts and ideas there came, once or twice, the image of Nastasia Philipovna. The general sighed.",
            "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, really sorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s a ruined woman. Mad! mad! However, the prince is not for Nastasia Philipovna now,\u2014perhaps it\u2019s as well.\u201d",
            "Two more of Nastasia\u2019s guests, who walked a short distance together, indulged in high moral sentiments of a similar nature.",
            "\u201cDo you know, Totski, this is all very like what they say goes on among the Japanese?\u201d said Ptitsin. \u201cThe offended party there, they say, marches off to his insulter and says to him, \u2018You insulted me, so I have come to rip myself open before your eyes;\u2019 and with these words he does actually rip his stomach open before his enemy, and considers, doubtless, that he is having all possible and necessary satisfaction and revenge. There are strange characters in the world, sir!\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! and you think there was something of this sort here, do you? Dear me\u2014a very remarkable comparison, you know! But you must have observed, my dear Ptitsin, that I did all I possibly could. I could do no more than I did. And you must admit that there are some rare qualities in this woman. I felt I could not speak in that Bedlam, or I should have been tempted to cry out, when she reproached me, that she herself was my best justification. Such a woman could make anyone forget all reason\u2014everything! Even that moujik, Rogojin, you saw, brought her a hundred thousand roubles! Of course, all that happened tonight was ephemeral, fantastic, unseemly\u2014yet it lacked neither colour nor originality. My God! What might not have been made of such a character combined with such beauty! Yet in spite of all efforts\u2014in spite of all education, even\u2014all those gifts are wasted! She is an uncut diamond.... I have often said so.\u201d",

            "It was said that there were other reasons for his hurried departure; but as to this, and as to his movements in Moscow, and as to his prolonged absence from St. Petersburg, we are able to give very little information.",
            "The prince was away for six months, and even those who were most interested in his destiny were able to pick up very little news about him all that while. True, certain rumours did reach his friends, but these were both strange and rare, and each one contradicted the last.",
            "Of course the Epanchin family was much interested in his movements, though he had not had time to bid them farewell before his departure. The general, however, had had an opportunity of seeing him once or twice since the eventful evening, and had spoken very seriously with him; but though he had seen the prince, as I say, he told his family nothing about the circumstance. In fact, for a month or so after his departure it was considered not the thing to mention the prince\u2019s name in the Epanchin household. Only Mrs. Epanchin, at the commencement of this period, had announced that she had been \u201ccruelly mistaken in the prince!\u201d and a day or two after, she had added, evidently alluding to him, but not mentioning his name, that it was an unalterable characteristic of hers to be mistaken in people. Then once more, ten days later, after some passage of arms with one of her daughters, she had remarked sententiously. \u201cWe have had enough of mistakes. I shall be more careful in future!\u201d However, it was impossible to avoid remarking that there was some sense of oppression in the household\u2014something unspoken, but felt; something strained. All the members of the family wore frowning looks. The general was unusually busy; his family hardly ever saw him.",
            "As to the girls, nothing was said openly, at all events; and probably very little in private. They were proud damsels, and were not always perfectly confidential even among themselves. But they understood each other thoroughly at the first word on all occasions; very often at the first glance, so that there was no need of much talking as a rule.",
            "One fact, at least, would have been perfectly plain to an outsider, had any such person been on the spot; and that was, that the prince had made a very considerable impression upon the family, in spite of the fact that he had but once been inside the house, and then only for a short time. Of course, if analyzed, this impression might have proved to be nothing more than a feeling of curiosity; but be it what it might, there it undoubtedly was.",
            "Little by little, the rumours spread about town became lost in a maze of uncertainty. It was said that some foolish young prince, name unknown, had suddenly come into possession of a gigantic fortune, and had married a French ballet dancer. This was contradicted, and the rumour circulated that it was a young merchant who had come into the enormous fortune and married the great ballet dancer, and that at the wedding the drunken young fool had burned seventy thousand roubles at a candle out of pure bravado.",
            "However, all these rumours soon died down, to which circumstance certain facts largely contributed. For instance, the whole of the Rogojin troop had departed, with him at their head, for Moscow. This was exactly a week after a dreadful orgy at the Ekaterinhof gardens, where Nastasia Philipovna had been present. It became known that after this orgy Nastasia Philipovna had entirely disappeared, and that she had since been traced to Moscow; so that the exodus of the Rogojin band was found consistent with this report.",
            "There were rumours current as to Gania, too; but circumstances soon contradicted these. He had fallen seriously ill, and his illness precluded his appearance in society, and even at business, for over a month. As soon as he had recovered, however, he threw up his situation in the public company under General Epanchin\u2019s direction, for some unknown reason, and the post was given to another. He never went near the Epanchins\u2019 house at all, and was exceedingly irritable and depressed.",
            "Varvara Ardalionovna married Ptitsin this winter, and it was said that the fact of Gania\u2019s retirement from business was the ultimate cause of the marriage, since Gania was now not only unable to support his family, but even required help himself.",
            "We may mention that Gania was no longer mentioned in the Epanchin household any more than the prince was; but that a certain circumstance in connection with the fatal evening at Nastasia\u2019s house became known to the general, and, in fact, to all the family the very next day. This fact was that Gania had come home that night, but had refused to go to bed. He had awaited the prince\u2019s return from Ekaterinhof with feverish impatience.",
            "On the latter\u2019s arrival, at six in the morning, Gania had gone to him in his room, bringing with him the singed packet of money, which he had insisted that the prince should return to Nastasia Philipovna without delay. It was said that when Gania entered the prince\u2019s room, he came with anything but friendly feelings, and in a condition of despair and misery; but that after a short conversation, he had stayed on for a couple of hours with him, sobbing continuously and bitterly the whole time. They had parted upon terms of cordial friendship.",
            "The Epanchins heard about this, as well as about the episode at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s. It was strange, perhaps, that the facts should become so quickly, and fairly accurately, known. As far as Gania was concerned, it might have been supposed that the news had come through Varvara Ardalionovna, who had suddenly become a frequent visitor of the Epanchin girls, greatly to their mother\u2019s surprise. But though Varvara had seen fit, for some reason, to make friends with them, it was not likely that she would have talked to them about her brother. She had plenty of pride, in spite of the fact that in thus acting she was seeking intimacy with people who had practically shown her brother the door. She and the Epanchin girls had been acquainted in childhood, although of late they had met but rarely. Even now Varvara hardly ever appeared in the drawing-room, but would slip in by a back way. Lizabetha Prokofievna, who disliked Varvara, although she had a great respect for her mother, was much annoyed by this sudden intimacy, and put it down to the general \u201ccontrariness\u201d of her daughters, who were \u201calways on the lookout for some new way of opposing her.\u201d Nevertheless, Varvara continued her visits.",
            "A month after Muishkin\u2019s departure, Mrs. Epanchin received a letter from her old friend Princess Bielokonski (who had lately left for Moscow), which letter put her into the greatest good humour. She did not divulge its contents either to her daughters or the general, but her conduct towards the former became affectionate in the extreme. She even made some sort of confession to them, but they were unable to understand what it was about. She actually relaxed towards the general a little\u2014he had been long disgraced\u2014and though she managed to quarrel with them all the next day, yet she soon came round, and from her general behaviour it was to be concluded that she had had good news of some sort, which she would like, but could not make up her mind, to disclose.",
            "However, a week later she received another letter from the same source, and at last resolved to speak.",
            "She solemnly announced that she had heard from old Princess Bielokonski, who had given her most comforting news about \u201cthat queer young prince.\u201d Her friend had hunted him up, and found that all was going well with him. He had since called in person upon her, making an extremely favourable impression, for the princess had received him each day since, and had introduced him into several good houses.",
            "The girls could see that their mother concealed a great deal from them, and left out large pieces of the letter in reading it to them.",
            "However, the ice was broken, and it suddenly became possible to mention the prince\u2019s name again. And again it became evident how very strong was the impression the young man had made in the household by his one visit there. Mrs. Epanchin was surprised at the effect which the news from Moscow had upon the girls, and they were no less surprised that after solemnly remarking that her most striking characteristic was \u201cbeing mistaken in people\u201d she should have troubled to obtain for the prince the favour and protection of so powerful an old lady as the Princess Bielokonski. As soon as the ice was thus broken, the general lost no time in showing that he, too, took the greatest interest in the subject. He admitted that he was interested, but said that it was merely in the business side of the question. It appeared that, in the interests of the prince, he had made arrangements in Moscow for a careful watch to be kept upon the prince\u2019s business affairs, and especially upon Salaskin. All that had been said as to the prince being an undoubted heir to a fortune turned out to be perfectly true; but the fortune proved to be much smaller than was at first reported. The estate was considerably encumbered with debts; creditors turned up on all sides, and the prince, in spite of all advice and entreaty, insisted upon managing all matters of claim himself\u2014which, of course, meant satisfying everybody all round, although half the claims were absolutely fraudulent.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin confirmed all this. She said the princess had written to much the same effect, and added that there was no curing a fool. But it was plain, from her expression of face, how strongly she approved of this particular young fool\u2019s doings. In conclusion, the general observed that his wife took as great an interest in the prince as though he were her own son; and that she had commenced to be especially affectionate towards Aglaya was a self-evident fact.",
            "All this caused the general to look grave and important. But, alas! this agreeable state of affairs very soon changed once more.",
            "A couple of weeks went by, and suddenly the general and his wife were once more gloomy and silent, and the ice was as firm as ever. The fact was, the general, who had heard first, how Nastasia Philipovna had fled to Moscow and had been discovered there by Rogojin; that she had then disappeared once more, and been found again by Rogojin, and how after that she had almost promised to marry him, now received news that she had once more disappeared, almost on the very day fixed for her wedding, flying somewhere into the interior of Russia this time, and that Prince Muishkin had left all his affairs in the hands of Salaskin and disappeared also\u2014but whether he was with Nastasia, or had only set off in search of her, was unknown.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna received confirmatory news from the princess\u2014and alas, two months after the prince\u2019s first departure from St. Petersburg, darkness and mystery once more enveloped his whereabouts and actions, and in the Epanchin family the ice of silence once more formed over the subject. Varia, however, informed the girls of what had happened, she having received the news from Ptitsin, who generally knew more than most people.",
            "To make an end, we may say that there were many changes in the Epanchin household in the spring, so that it was not difficult to forget the prince, who sent no news of himself.",
            "The Epanchin family had at last made up their minds to spend the summer abroad, all except the general, who could not waste time in \u201ctravelling for enjoyment,\u201d of course. This arrangement was brought about by the persistence of the girls, who insisted that they were never allowed to go abroad because their parents were too anxious to marry them off. Perhaps their parents had at last come to the conclusion that husbands might be found abroad, and that a summer\u2019s travel might bear fruit. The marriage between Alexandra and Totski had been broken off. Since the prince\u2019s departure from St. Petersburg no more had been said about it; the subject had been dropped without ceremony, much to the joy of Mrs. General, who, announced that she was \u201cready to cross herself with both hands\u201d in gratitude for the escape. The general, however, regretted Totski for a long while. \u201cSuch a fortune!\u201d he sighed, \u201cand such a good, easy-going fellow!\u201d",
            "After a time it became known that Totski had married a French marquise, and was to be carried off by her to Paris, and then to Brittany.",
            "\u201cOh, well,\u201d thought the general, \u201che\u2019s lost to us for good, now.\u201d",
            "So the Epanchins prepared to depart for the summer.",
            "But now another circumstance occurred, which changed all the plans once more, and again the intended journey was put off, much to the delight of the general and his spouse.",
            "A certain Prince S\u2014\u2014 arrived in St. Petersburg from Moscow, an eminent and honourable young man. He was one of those active persons who always find some good work with which to employ themselves. Without forcing himself upon the public notice, modest and unobtrusive, this young prince was concerned with much that happened in the world in general.",
            "He had served, at first, in one of the civil departments, had then attended to matters connected with the local government of provincial towns, and had of late been a corresponding member of several important scientific societies. He was a man of excellent family and solid means, about thirty-five years of age.",
            "Prince S\u2014\u2014 made the acquaintance of the general\u2019s family, and Adelaida, the second girl, made a great impression upon him. Towards the spring he proposed to her, and she accepted him. The general and his wife were delighted. The journey abroad was put off, and the wedding was fixed for a day not very distant.",
            "The trip abroad might have been enjoyed later on by Mrs. Epanchin and her two remaining daughters, but for another circumstance.",
            "It so happened that Prince S\u2014\u2014 introduced a distant relation of his own into the Epanchin family\u2014one Evgenie Pavlovitch, a young officer of about twenty-eight years of age, whose conquests among the ladies in Moscow had been proverbial. This young gentleman no sooner set eyes on Aglaya than he became a frequent visitor at the house. He was witty, well-educated, and extremely wealthy, as the general very soon discovered. His past reputation was the only thing against him.",
            "Nothing was said; there were not even any hints dropped; but still, it seemed better to the parents to say nothing more about going abroad this season, at all events. Aglaya herself perhaps was of a different opinion.",
            "All this happened just before the second appearance of our hero upon the scene.",
            "By this time, to judge from appearances, poor Prince Muishkin had been quite forgotten in St. Petersburg. If he had appeared suddenly among his acquaintances, he would have been received as one from the skies; but we must just glance at one more fact before we conclude this preface.",
            "Colia Ivolgin, for some time after the prince\u2019s departure, continued his old life. That is, he went to school, looked after his father, helped Varia in the house, and ran her errands, and went frequently to see his friend, Hippolyte.",
            "The lodgers had disappeared very quickly\u2014Ferdishenko soon after the events at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s, while the prince went to Moscow, as we know. Gania and his mother went to live with Varia and Ptitsin immediately after the latter\u2019s wedding, while the general was housed in a debtor\u2019s prison by reason of certain IOU\u2019s given to the captain\u2019s widow under the impression that they would never be formally used against him. This unkind action much surprised poor Ardalion Alexandrovitch, the victim, as he called himself, of an \u201cunbounded trust in the nobility of the human heart.\u201d",
            "When he signed those notes of hand he never dreamt that they would be a source of future trouble. The event showed that he was mistaken. \u201cTrust in anyone after this! Have the least confidence in man or woman!\u201d he cried in bitter tones, as he sat with his new friends in prison, and recounted to them his favourite stories of the siege of Kars, and the resuscitated soldier. On the whole, he accommodated himself very well to his new position. Ptitsin and Varia declared that he was in the right place, and Gania was of the same opinion. The only person who deplored his fate was poor Nina Alexandrovna, who wept bitter tears over him, to the great surprise of her household, and, though always in feeble health, made a point of going to see him as often as possible.",
            "Since the general\u2019s \u201cmishap,\u201d as Colia called it, and the marriage of his sister, the boy had quietly possessed himself of far more freedom. His relations saw little of him, for he rarely slept at home. He made many new friends; and was moreover, a frequent visitor at the debtor\u2019s prison, to which he invariably accompanied his mother. Varia, who used to be always correcting him, never spoke to him now on the subject of his frequent absences, and the whole household was surprised to see Gania, in spite of his depression, on quite friendly terms with his brother. This was something new, for Gania had been wont to look upon Colia as a kind of errand-boy, treating him with contempt, threatening to \u201cpull his ears,\u201d and in general driving him almost wild with irritation. It seemed now that Gania really needed his brother, and the latter, for his part, felt as if he could forgive Gania much since he had returned the hundred thousand roubles offered to him by Nastasia Philipovna. Three months after the departure of the prince, the Ivolgin family discovered that Colia had made acquaintance with the Epanchins, and was on very friendly terms with the daughters. Varia heard of it first, though Colia had not asked her to introduce him. Little by little the family grew quite fond of him. Madame Epanchin at first looked on him with disdain, and received him coldly, but in a short time he grew to please her, because, as she said, he \u201cwas candid and no flatterer\u201d\u2014a very true description. From the first he put himself on an equality with his new friends, and though he sometimes read newspapers and books to the mistress of the house, it was simply because he liked to be useful.",
            "One day, however, he and Lizabetha Prokofievna quarrelled seriously about the \u201cwoman question,\u201d in the course of a lively discussion on that burning subject. He told her that she was a tyrant, and that he would never set foot in her house again. It may seem incredible, but a day or two after, Madame Epanchin sent a servant with a note begging him to return, and Colia, without standing on his dignity, did so at once.",
            "Aglaya was the only one of the family whose good graces he could not gain, and who always spoke to him haughtily, but it so happened that the boy one day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise.",
            "It was about Easter, when, taking advantage of a momentary t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate Colia handed Aglaya a letter, remarking that he \u201chad orders to deliver it to her privately.\u201d She stared at him in amazement, but he did not wait to hear what she had to say, and went out. Aglaya broke the seal, and read as follows:",
            "\u201cOnce you did me the honour of giving me your confidence. Perhaps you have quite forgotten me now! How is it that I am writing to you? I do not know; but I am conscious of an irresistible desire to remind you of my existence, especially you. How many times I have needed all three of you; but only you have dwelt always in my mind\u2019s eye. I need you\u2014I need you very much. I will not write about myself. I have nothing to tell you. But I long for you to be happy. _Are_ you happy? That is all I wished to say to you\u2014Your brother,",
            " \u201cPr. L. Muishkin.\u201d",
            " On reading this short and disconnected note, Aglaya suddenly blushed all over, and became very thoughtful.",
            "It would be difficult to describe her thoughts at that moment. One of them was, \u201cShall I show it to anyone?\u201d But she was ashamed to show it. So she ended by hiding it in her table drawer, with a very strange, ironical smile upon her lips.",
            "Next day, she took it out, and put it into a large book, as she usually did with papers which she wanted to be able to find easily. She laughed when, about a week later, she happened to notice the name of the book, and saw that it was Don Quixote, but it would be difficult to say exactly why.",
            "I cannot say, either, whether she showed the letter to her sisters.",
            "But when she had read it herself once more, it suddenly struck her that surely that conceited boy, Colia, had not been the one chosen correspondent of the prince all this while. She determined to ask him, and did so with an exaggerated show of carelessness. He informed her haughtily that though he had given the prince his permanent address when the latter left town, and had offered his services, the prince had never before given him any commission to perform, nor had he written until the following lines arrived, with Aglaya\u2019s letter. Aglaya took the note, and read it.",
            "\u201cDEAR COLIA,\u2014Please be so kind as to give the enclosed sealed letter to Aglaya Ivanovna. Keep well\u2014Ever your loving,",
            " \u201cPr. L. Muishkin.\u201d",
            " \u201cIt seems absurd to trust a little pepper-box like you,\u201d said Aglaya, as she returned the note, and walked past the \u201cpepper-box\u201d with an expression of great contempt.",
            "This was more than Colia could bear. He had actually borrowed Gania\u2019s new green tie for the occasion, without saying why he wanted it, in order to impress her. He was very deeply mortified. "

        "II.": [
            "His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance. But what is there that people will not smile at?",
            "The prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he soon discovered the house he was seeking. It was a small wooden villa, and he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in a pleasant little garden, full of flowers. The windows looking on the street were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making a speech, came through them. It rose at times to a shout, and was interrupted occasionally by bursts of laughter.",
            "Prince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps. A cook with her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door. The visitor asked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home.",
            "\u201cHe is in there,\u201d said she, pointing to the salon.",
            "The room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously, furnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under a glass shade. There was a narrow pier-glass against the wall, and a chandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the ceiling.",
            "When the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the room, his back to the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of the extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of his speech, and was impressively beating his breast.",
            "His audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a clever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a young lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant in her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing loudly, her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man, with black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. He frequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great delight of the others.",
            "\u201cLukian Timofeyovitch! Lukian Timofeyovitch! Here\u2019s someone to see you! Look here!... a gentleman to speak to you!... Well, it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d and the cook turned and went away red with anger.",
            "Lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a moment. Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped short again.",
            "\u201cPrince! ex-ex-excellency!\u201d he stammered. Then suddenly he ran towards the girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she staggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other child, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway. She screamed, and ran towards the kitchen. Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily; then, seeing the prince regarding him with amazement, he murmured apologetically\u2014\u201cPardon to show respect!... he-he!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are quite wrong...\u201d began the prince.",
            "\u201cAt once... at once... in one moment!\u201d",
            "He rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked inquiringly at the others.",
            "They were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus.",
            "\u201cHe has gone to get his coat,\u201d said the boy.",
            "\u201cHow annoying!\u201d exclaimed the prince. \u201cI thought... Tell me, is he...\u201d",
            "\u201cYou think he is drunk?\u201d cried the young man on the sofa. \u201cNot in the least. He\u2019s only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but what is that? The usual thing!\u201d",
            "As the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the girl, whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness.",
            "\u201cHe never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business with him, do it now. It is the best time. He sometimes comes back drunk in the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening in tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our mother died five weeks ago.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you,\u201d said the youth on the divan. \u201cI bet he is trying to cheat you, and is thinking how best to do it.\u201d",
            "Just then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat.",
            "\u201cFive weeks!\u201d said he, wiping his eyes. \u201cOnly five weeks! Poor orphans!\u201d",
            "\u201cBut why wear a coat in holes,\u201d asked the girl, \u201cwhen your new one is hanging behind the door? Did you not see it?\u201d",
            "\u201cHold your tongue, dragon-fly!\u201d he scolded. \u201cWhat a plague you are!\u201d He stamped his foot irritably, but she only laughed, and answered:",
            "\u201cAre you trying to frighten me? I am not Tania, you know, and I don\u2019t intend to run away. Look, you are waking Lubotchka, and she will have convulsions again. Why do you shout like that?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, well! I won\u2019t again,\u201d said the master of the house, his anxiety getting the better of his temper. He went up to his daughter, and looked at the child in her arms, anxiously making the sign of the cross over her three times. \u201cGod bless her! God bless her!\u201d he cried with emotion. \u201cThis little creature is my daughter Luboff,\u201d addressing the prince. \u201cMy wife, Helena, died\u2014at her birth; and this is my big daughter Vera, in mourning, as you see; and this, this, oh, this,\u201d pointing to the young man on the divan...",
            "\u201cWell, go on! never mind me!\u201d mocked the other. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid!\u201d",
            "\u201cExcellency! Have you read that account of the murder of the Zemarin family, in the newspaper?\u201d cried Lebedeff, all of a sudden.",
            "\u201cYes,\u201d said Muishkin, with some surprise.",
            "\u201cWell, that is the murderer! It is he\u2014in fact\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked the visitor.",
            "\u201cI am speaking allegorically, of course; but he will be the murderer of a Zemarin family in the future. He is getting ready. ...\u201d",
            "They all laughed, and the thought crossed the prince\u2019s mind that perhaps Lebedeff was really trifling in this way because he foresaw inconvenient questions, and wanted to gain time.",
            "\u201cHe is a traitor! a conspirator!\u201d shouted Lebedeff, who seemed to have lost all control over himself. \u201cA monster! a slanderer! Ought I to treat him as a nephew, the son of my sister Anisia?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! do be quiet! You must be drunk! He has taken it into his head to play the lawyer, prince, and he practices speechifying, and is always repeating his eloquent pleadings to his children. And who do you think was his last client? An old woman who had been robbed of five hundred roubles, her all, by some rogue of a usurer, besought him to take up her case, instead of which he defended the usurer himself, a Jew named Zeidler, because this Jew promised to give him fifty roubles....\u201d",
            "\u201cIt was to be fifty if I won the case, only five if I lost,\u201d interrupted Lebedeff, speaking in a low tone, a great contrast to his earlier manner.",
            "\u201cWell! naturally he came to grief: the law is not administered as it used to be, and he only got laughed at for his pains. But he was much pleased with himself in spite of that. \u2018Most learned judge!\u2019 said he, \u2018picture this unhappy man, crippled by age and infirmities, who gains his living by honourable toil\u2014picture him, I repeat, robbed of his all, of his last mouthful; remember, I entreat you, the words of that learned legislator, \u201cLet mercy and justice alike rule the courts of law.\u201d\u2019 Now, would you believe it, excellency, every morning he recites this speech to us from beginning to end, exactly as he spoke it before the magistrate. To-day we have heard it for the fifth time. He was just starting again when you arrived, so much does he admire it. He is now preparing to undertake another case. I think, by the way, that you are Prince Muishkin? Colia tells me you are the cleverest man he has ever known....\u201d",
            "\u201cThe cleverest in the world,\u201d interrupted his uncle hastily.",
            "\u201cI do not pay much attention to that opinion,\u201d continued the young man calmly. \u201cColia is very fond of you, but he,\u201d pointing to Lebedeff, \u201cis flattering you. I can assure you I have no intention of flattering you, or anyone else, but at least you have some common-sense. Well, will you judge between us? Shall we ask the prince to act as arbitrator?\u201d he went on, addressing his uncle.",
            "\u201cI am so glad you chanced to come here, prince.\u201d",
            "\u201cI agree,\u201d said Lebedeff, firmly, looking round involuntarily at his daughter, who had come nearer, and was listening attentively to the conversation.",
            "\u201cWhat is it all about?\u201d asked the prince, frowning. His head ached, and he felt sure that Lebedeff was trying to cheat him in some way, and only talking to put off the explanation that he had come for.",
            "\u201cI will tell you all the story. I am his nephew; he did speak the truth there, although he is generally telling lies. I am at the University, and have not yet finished my course. I mean to do so, and I shall, for I have a determined character. I must, however, find something to do for the present, and therefore I have got employment on the railway at twenty-four roubles a month. I admit that my uncle has helped me once or twice before. Well, I had twenty roubles in my pocket, and I gambled them away. Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have paid!\u201d cried Lebedeff.",
            "\u201cYes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him,\u201d said the young man. \u201cAs to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it because he beat you. He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the service, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojin\u2019s followers. They are all lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off. Of course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a card-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last rouble. To tell the truth, I thought to myself, \u2018If I lose, I will go to my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.\u2019 Now that was base\u2014cowardly and base!\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is so,\u201d observed Lebedeff quietly; \u201ccowardly and base.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph,\u201d said the nephew viciously; for the words seemed to irritate him. \u201cHe is delighted! I came to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did not excuse myself. I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone here can witness. But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new post, for I am really like a tramp. Just look at my boots! I cannot possibly appear like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time appointed, the job will be given to someone else; and I shall have to try for another. Now I only beg for fifteen roubles, and I give my word that I will never ask him for anything again. I am also ready to promise to repay my debt in three months\u2019 time, and I will keep my word, even if I have to live on bread and water. My salary will amount to seventy-five roubles in three months. The sum I now ask, added to what I have borrowed already, will make a total of about thirty-five roubles, so you see I shall have enough to pay him and confound him! if he wants interest, he shall have that, too! Haven\u2019t I always paid back the money he lent me before? Why should he be so mean now? He grudges my having paid that lieutenant; there can be no other reason! That\u2019s the kind he is\u2014a dog in the manger!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd he won\u2019t go away!\u201d cried Lebedeff. \u201cHe has installed himself here, and here he remains!\u201d",
            "\u201cI have told you already, that I will not go away until I have got what I ask. Why are you smiling, prince? You look as if you disapproved of me.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am not smiling, but I really think you are in the wrong, somewhat,\u201d replied Muishkin, reluctantly.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t shuffle! Say plainly that you think that I am quite wrong, without any \u2018somewhat\u2019! Why \u2018somewhat\u2019?\u201d",
            "\u201cI will say you are quite wrong, if you wish.\u201d",
            "\u201cIf I wish! That\u2019s good, I must say! Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct? I am quite aware that his money is his own, and that my action\u2014is much like an attempt at extortion. But you-you don\u2019t know what life is! If people don\u2019t learn by experience, they never understand. They must be taught. My intentions are perfectly honest; on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will pay back the money with interest. Added to which he has had the moral satisfaction of seeing me disgraced. What does he want more? and what is he good for if he never helps anyone? Look what he does himself! just ask him about his dealings with others, how he deceives people! How did he manage to buy this house? You may cut off my head if he has not let you in for something\u2014and if he is not trying to cheat you again. You are smiling. You don\u2019t believe me?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt seems to me that all this has nothing to do with your affairs,\u201d remarked the prince.",
            "\u201cI have lain here now for three days,\u201d cried the young man without noticing, \u201cand I have seen a lot! Fancy! he suspects his daughter, that angel, that orphan, my cousin\u2014he suspects her, and every evening he searches her room, to see if she has a lover hidden in it! He comes here too on tiptoe, creeping softly\u2014oh, so softly\u2014and looks under the sofa\u2014my bed, you know. He is mad with suspicion, and sees a thief in every corner. He runs about all night long; he was up at least seven times last night, to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were barred, and to peep into the oven. That man who appears in court for scoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate, banging his head on the ground by the half-hour\u2014and for whom do you think he prays? Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions? I have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul of the Countess du Barry! Colia heard it too. He is as mad as a March hare!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou hear how he slanders me, prince,\u201d said Lebedeff, almost beside himself with rage. \u201cI may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at least I can say one thing for myself. He does not know\u2014how should he, mocker that he is?\u2014that when he came into the world it was I who washed him, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia had lost her husband, and was in great poverty. I was very little better off than she, but I sat up night after night with her, and nursed both mother and child; I used to go downstairs and steal wood for them from the house-porter. How often did I sing him to sleep when I was half dead with hunger! In short, I was more than a father to him, and now\u2014now he jeers at me! Even if I did cross myself, and pray for the repose of the soul of the Comtesse du Barry, what does it matter? Three days ago, for the first time in my life, I read her biography in an historical dictionary. Do you know who she was? You there!\u201d addressing his nephew. \u201cSpeak! do you know?\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course no one knows anything about her but you,\u201d muttered the young man in a would-be jeering tone.",
            "\u201cShe was a Countess who rose from shame to reign like a Queen. An Empress wrote to her, with her own hand, as \u2018_Ma ch\u00e8re cousine_.\u2019 At a _lever-du-roi_ one morning (do you know what a _lever-du-roi_ was?)\u2014a Cardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour! Did you know this? I see by your expression that you did not! Well, how did she die? Answer!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! do stop\u2014you are too absurd!\u201d",
            "\u201cThis is how she died. After all this honour and glory, after having been almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson. She was quite innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the fishwives of Paris. She was so terrified, that she did not understand what was happening. But when Samson seized her head, and pushed her under the knife with his foot, she cried out: \u2018Wait a moment! wait a moment, monsieur!\u2019 Well, because of that moment of bitter suffering, perhaps the Saviour will pardon her other faults, for one cannot imagine a greater agony. As I read the story my heart bled for her. And what does it matter to you, little worm, if I implored the Divine mercy for her, great sinner as she was, as I said my evening prayer? I might have done it because I doubted if anyone had ever crossed himself for her sake before. It may be that in the other world she will rejoice to think that a sinner like herself has cried to heaven for the salvation of her soul. Why are you laughing? You believe nothing, atheist! And your story was not even correct! If you had listened to what I was saying, you would have heard that I did not only pray for the Comtesse du Barry. I said, \u2018Oh Lord! give rest to the soul of that great sinner, the Comtesse du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.\u2019 You see that is quite a different thing, for how many sinners there are, how many women, who have passed through the trials of this life, are now suffering and groaning in purgatory! I prayed for you, too, in spite of your insolence and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that you claim to know how I pray...\u201d",

I never said he was a man without heart, but he is a rascal\u2014that\u2019s the pity of it. And then, he is addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most people who have taken more than is good for them for years. He loves his children\u2014oh, I know that well enough! He respected my aunt, his late wife... and he even has a sort of affection for me. He has remembered me in his will.\u201d",

            "\u201cListen to me, Lebedeff,\u201d said the prince in a decided voice, turning his back on the young man. \u201cI know by experience that when you choose, you can be business-like... I have very little time to spare, and if you... By the way\u2014excuse me\u2014what is your Christian name? I have forgotten it.\u201d",

Now do tell us why you must needs lie about it? Lukian or Timofey, it is all the same to you, and what difference can it make to the prince? He tells lies without the least necessity, simply by force of habit, I assure you.\u201d",

            "\u201cColia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father, whom you let out of prison by paying his debts\u2014Heaven only knows why! Yesterday the general promised to come and lodge here, but he did not appear. Most probably he slept at the hotel close by. No doubt Colia is there, unless he has gone to Pavlofsk to see the Epanchins. He had a little money, and was intending to go there yesterday. He must be either at the hotel or at Pavlofsk.\u201d",

He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!\u201d interrupted Lebedeff.... \u201cBut come\u2014let us go into the garden\u2014we will have coffee there....\u201d And Lebedeff seized the prince\u2019s arm, and led him from the room. They went across the yard, and found themselves in a delightful little garden with the trees already in their summer dress of green, thanks to the unusually fine weather. Lebedeff invited his guest to sit down on a green seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth, and took a seat facing him. In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the prince did not refuse it. The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin, with an expression of passionate servility.",

            "\u201cI think I understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch: you were not sure that I should come. You did not think I should start at the first word from you, and you merely wrote to relieve your conscience. However, you see now that I have come, and I have had enough of trickery. Give up serving, or trying to serve, two masters. Rogojin has been here these three weeks. Have you managed to sell her to him as you did before? Tell me the truth.\u201d",

She cares as much for _him_ as for a piece of orange-peel\u2014not more. Yet I am much mistaken if she does not look on him with fear and trembling. She forbids his name to be mentioned before her, and they only meet when unavoidable. He understands, well enough! But it must be gone through.

She has a liking for conversation on serious subjects, of any kind; in fact they please her so much, that it flatters her to discuss them. Now for fifteen years at least I have studied the Apocalypse, and she agrees with me in thinking that the present is the epoch represented by the third horse, the black one whose rider holds a measure in his hand. It seems to me that everything is ruled by measure in our century; all men are clamouring for their rights; \u2018a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny.\u2019 But, added to this, men desire freedom of mind and body, a pure heart, a healthy life, and all God\u2019s good gifts. Now by pleading their rights alone, they will never attain all this, so the white horse, with his rider Death, comes next, and is followed by Hell. We talked about this matter when we met, and it impressed her very much.\u201d",

He is a target for all the world, the butt of any fool who chooses to kick him. But in interpreting revelation I am the equal of anyone, great as he may be! Such is the power of the mind and the spirit. I have made a lordly personage tremble, as he sat in his armchair... only by talking to him of things concerning the spirit. Two years ago, on Easter Eve, His Excellency Nil Alexeyovitch, whose subordinate I was then, wished to hear what I had to say, and sent a message by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his private room. \u2018They tell me you expound the prophecies relating to Antichrist,\u2019 said he, when we were alone. \u2018Is that so?\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 I answered unhesitatingly, and I began to give some comments on the Apostle\u2019s allegorical vision. At first he smiled, but when we reached the numerical computations and correspondences, he trembled, and turned pale. Then he begged me to close the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on the reward list. That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight days later his soul returned to God.\u201d",

            "\u201cIt is the truth. One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped out of his carriage. He fell, and struck his head on the curb, and died immediately. He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and white hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like a child. Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said, \u2018_you foretold his death._\u2019\u201d",

            "\u201cYou are going to Pavlofsk too?\u201d asked the prince sharply. \u201cEverybody seems to be going there. Have you a house in that neighbourhood?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house, Ivan Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply.

Not that he had any difficulty in finding a tenant; in fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had told Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months. The clerk knew very well that this \u201c_perhaps_\u201d meant \u201c_certainly_,\u201d but as he thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt justified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitant\u2019s intentions. \u201cThis is quite a coincidence,\u201d thought he, and when the subject of price was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if to waive away a question of so little importance.",

            "The prince knew that if he called at the Epanchins\u2019 now he would only find the general, and that the latter might probably carry him straight off to Pavlofsk with him; whereas there was one visit he was most anxious to make without delay.",
            "So at the risk of missing General Epanchin altogether, and thus postponing his visit to Pavlofsk for a day, at least, the prince decided to go and look for the house he desired to find.",
            "The visit he was about to pay was, in some respects, a risky one. He was in two minds about it, but knowing that the house was in the Gorohovaya, not far from the Sadovaya, he determined to go in that direction, and to try to make up his mind on the way.",
            "Arrived at the point where the Gorohovaya crosses the Sadovaya, he was surprised to find how excessively agitated he was. He had no idea that his heart could beat so painfully.",
            "One house in the Gorohovaya began to attract his attention long before he reached it, and the prince remembered afterwards that he had said to himself: \u201cThat is the house, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d He came up to it quite curious to discover whether he had guessed right, and felt that he would be disagreeably impressed to find that he had actually done so. The house was a large gloomy-looking structure, without the slightest claim to architectural beauty, in colour a dirty green. There are a few of these old houses, built towards the end of the last century, still standing in that part of St. Petersburg, and showing little change from their original form and colour. They are solidly built, and are remarkable for the thickness of their walls, and for the fewness of their windows, many of which are covered by gratings. On the ground-floor there is usually a money-changer\u2019s shop, and the owner lives over it. Without as well as within, the houses seem inhospitable and mysterious\u2014an impression which is difficult to explain, unless it has something to do with the actual architectural style. These houses are almost exclusively inhabited by the merchant class.",
            "Arrived at the gate, the prince looked up at the legend over it, which ran:",

            "He hesitated no longer; but opened the glazed door at the bottom of the outer stairs and made his way up to the second storey. The place was dark and gloomy-looking; the walls of the stone staircase were painted a dull red. Rogojin and his mother and brother occupied the whole of the second floor. The servant who opened the door to Muishkin led him, without taking his name, through several rooms and up and down many steps until they arrived at a door, where he knocked.",
            "Parfen Rogojin opened the door himself.",
            "On seeing the prince he became deadly white, and apparently fixed to the ground, so that he was more like a marble statue than a human being. The prince had expected some surprise, but Rogojin evidently considered his visit an impossible and miraculous event. He stared with an expression almost of terror, and his lips twisted into a bewildered smile.",
            "\u201cParfen! perhaps my visit is ill-timed. I\u2014I can go away again if you like,\u201d said Muishkin at last, rather embarrassed.",
            "\u201cNo, no; it\u2019s all right, come in,\u201d said Parfen, recollecting himself.",
            "They were evidently on quite familiar terms. In Moscow they had had many occasions of meeting; indeed, some few of those meetings were but too vividly impressed upon their memories. They had not met now, however, for three months.",
            "The deathlike pallor, and a sort of slight convulsion about the lips, had not left Rogojin\u2019s face. Though he welcomed his guest, he was still obviously much disturbed. As he invited the prince to sit down near the table, the latter happened to turn towards him, and was startled by the strange expression on his face. A painful recollection flashed into his mind. He stood for a time, looking straight at Rogojin, whose eyes seemed to blaze like fire. At last Rogojin smiled, though he still looked agitated and shaken.",
            "\u201cWhat are you staring at me like that for?\u201d he muttered. \u201cSit down.\u201d",
            "The prince took a chair.",

            "\u201cOh, I supposed you were coming,\u201d the other replied, smiling sarcastically, \u201cand I was right in my supposition, you see; but how was I to know that you would come _today?_\u201d",
            "A certain strangeness and impatience in his manner impressed the prince very forcibly.",
            "\u201cAnd if you had known that I was coming today, why be so irritated about it?\u201d he asked, in quiet surprise.",
            "\u201cWhy did you ask me?\u201d",
            "\u201cBecause when I jumped out of the train this morning, two eyes glared at me just as yours did a moment since.\u201d",
            "\u201cHa! and whose eyes may they have been?\u201d said Rogojin, suspiciously. It seemed to the prince that he was trembling.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know; I thought it was a hallucination. I often have hallucinations nowadays. I feel just as I did five years ago when my fits were about to come on.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, perhaps it was a hallucination, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Parfen.",
            "He tried to give the prince an affectionate smile, and it seemed to the latter as though in this smile of his something had broken, and that he could not mend it, try as he would.",
            "\u201cShall you go abroad again then?\u201d he asked, and suddenly added, \u201cDo you remember how we came up in the train from Pskoff together? You and your cloak and leggings, eh?\u201d",
            "And Rogojin burst out laughing, this time with unconcealed malice, as though he were glad that he had been able to find an opportunity for giving vent to it.",
            "\u201cHave you quite taken up your quarters here?\u201d asked the prince",
            "\u201cYes, I\u2019m at home. Where else should I go to?\u201d",
            "\u201cWe haven\u2019t met for some time. Meanwhile I have heard things about you which I should not have believed to be possible.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat of that? People will say anything,\u201d said Rogojin drily.",
            "\u201cAt all events, you\u2019ve disbanded your troop\u2014and you are living in your own house instead of being fast and loose about the place; that\u2019s all very good. Is this house all yours, or joint property?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is my mother\u2019s. You get to her apartments by that passage.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d",
            "\u201cIn the other wing.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs he married?\u201d",
            "\u201cWidower. Why do you want to know all this?\u201d",
            "The prince looked at him, but said nothing. He had suddenly relapsed into musing, and had probably not heard the question at all. Rogojin did not insist upon an answer, and there was silence for a few moments.",
            "\u201cI guessed which was your house from a hundred yards off,\u201d said the prince at last.",
            "\u201cWhy so?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t quite know. Your house has the aspect of yourself and all your family; it bears the stamp of the Rogojin life; but ask me why I think so, and I can tell you nothing. It is nonsense, of course. I am nervous about this kind of thing troubling me so much. I had never before imagined what sort of a house you would live in, and yet no sooner did I set eyes on this one than I said to myself that it must be yours.\u201d",
            "\u201cReally!\u201d said Rogojin vaguely, not taking in what the prince meant by his rather obscure remarks.",
            "The room they were now sitting in was a large one, lofty but dark, well furnished, principally with writing-tables and desks covered with papers and books. A wide sofa covered with red morocco evidently served Rogojin for a bed. On the table beside which the prince had been invited to seat himself lay some books; one containing a marker where the reader had left off, was a volume of Solovieff\u2019s History. Some oil-paintings in worn gilded frames hung on the walls, but it was impossible to make out what subjects they represented, so blackened were they by smoke and age. One, a life-sized portrait, attracted the prince\u2019s attention. It showed a man of about fifty, wearing a long riding-coat of German cut. He had two medals on his breast; his beard was white, short and thin; his face yellow and wrinkled, with a sly, suspicious expression in the eyes.",
            "\u201cThat is your father, is it not?\u201d asked the prince.",
            "\u201cYes, it is,\u201d replied Rogojin with an unpleasant smile, as if he had expected his guest to ask the question, and then to make some disagreeable remark.",
            "\u201cWas he one of the Old Believers?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, he went to church, but to tell the truth he really preferred the old religion. This was his study and is now mine. Why did you ask if he were an Old Believer?\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you going to be married here?\u201d",
            "\u201cYe-yes!\u201d replied Rogojin, starting at the unexpected question.",
            "\u201cSoon?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou know yourself it does not depend on me.\u201d",
            "\u201cParfen, I am not your enemy, and I do not intend to oppose your intentions in any way. I repeat this to you now just as I said it to you once before on a very similar occasion. When you were arranging for your projected marriage in Moscow, I did not interfere with you\u2014you know I did not. That first time she fled to me from you, from the very altar almost, and begged me to \u2018save her from you.\u2019 Afterwards she ran away from me again, and you found her and arranged your marriage with her once more; and now, I hear, she has run away from you and come to Petersburg. Is it true? Lebedeff wrote me to this effect, and that\u2019s why I came here. That you had once more arranged matters with Nastasia Philipovna I only learned last night in the train from a friend of yours, Zaleshoff\u2014if you wish to know.",
            "\u201cI confess I came here with an object. I wished to persuade Nastasia to go abroad for her health; she requires it. Both mind and body need a change badly. I did not intend to take her abroad myself. I was going to arrange for her to go without me. Now I tell you honestly, Parfen, if it is true that all is made up between you, I will not so much as set eyes upon her, and I will never even come to see you again.",
            "\u201cYou know quite well that I am telling the truth, because I have always been frank with you. I have never concealed my own opinion from you. I have always told you that I consider a marriage between you and her would be ruin to her. You would also be ruined, and perhaps even more hopelessly. If this marriage were to be broken off again, I admit I should be greatly pleased; but at the same time I have not the slightest intention of trying to part you. You may be quite easy in your mind, and you need not suspect me. You know yourself whether I was ever really your rival or not, even when she ran away and came to me.",
            "\u201cThere, you are laughing at me\u2014I know why you laugh. It is perfectly true that we lived apart from one another all the time, in different towns. I told you before that I did not love her with love, but with pity! You said then that you understood me; did you really understand me or not? What hatred there is in your eyes at this moment! I came to relieve your mind, because you are dear to me also. I love you very much, Parfen; and now I shall go away and never come back again. Goodbye.\u201d",
            "The prince rose.",
            "\u201cStay a little,\u201d said Parfen, not leaving his chair and resting his head on his right hand. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a long time.\u201d",
            "The prince sat down again. Both were silent for a few moments.",
            "\u201cWhen you are not with me I hate you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I have loathed you every day of these three months since I last saw you. By heaven I have!\u201d said Rogojin. \u201cI could have poisoned you at any minute. Now, you have been with me but a quarter of an hour, and all my malice seems to have melted away, and you are as dear to me as ever. Stay here a little longer.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhen I am with you you trust me; but as soon as my back is turned you suspect me,\u201d said the prince, smiling, and trying to hide his emotion.",
            "\u201cI trust your voice, when I hear you speak. I quite understand that you and I cannot be put on a level, of course.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy did you add that?\u2014There! Now you are cross again,\u201d said the prince, wondering.",
            "\u201cWe were not asked, you see. We were made different, with different tastes and feelings, without being consulted. You say you love her with pity. I have no pity for her. She hates me\u2014that\u2019s the plain truth of the matter. I dream of her every night, and always that she is laughing at me with another man. And so she does laugh at me. She thinks no more of marrying me than if she were changing her shoe. Would you believe it, I haven\u2019t seen her for five days, and I daren\u2019t go near her. She asks me what I come for, as if she were not content with having disgraced me\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDisgraced you! How?\u201d",
            "\u201cJust as though you didn\u2019t know! Why, she ran away from me, and went to you. You admitted it yourself, just now.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut surely you do not believe that she...\u201d",
            "\u201cThat she did not disgrace me at Moscow with that officer, Zemtuznikoff? I know for certain she did, after having fixed our marriage-day herself!\u201d",
            "\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cI know it for a fact,\u201d replied Rogojin, with conviction.",
            "\u201cIt is not like her, you say? My friend, that\u2019s absurd. Perhaps such an act would horrify her, if she were with you, but it is quite different where I am concerned. She looks on me as vermin. Her affair with Keller was simply to make a laughing-stock of me. You don\u2019t know what a fool she made of me in Moscow; and the money I spent over her! The money! the money!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you can marry her now, Parfen! What will come of it all?\u201d said the prince, with dread in his voice.",
            "Rogojin gazed back gloomily, and with a terrible expression in his eyes, but said nothing.",
            "\u201cI haven\u2019t been to see her for five days,\u201d he repeated, after a slight pause. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of being turned out. She says she\u2019s still her own mistress, and may turn me off altogether, and go abroad. She told me this herself,\u201d he said, with a peculiar glance at Muishkin. \u201cI think she often does it merely to frighten me. She is always laughing at me, for some reason or other; but at other times she\u2019s angry, and won\u2019t say a word, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. I took her a shawl one day, the like of which she might never have seen, although she did live in luxury and she gave it away to her maid, Katia. Sometimes when I can keep away no longer, I steal past the house on the sly, and once I watched at the gate till dawn\u2014I thought something was going on\u2014and she saw me from the window. She asked me what I should do if I found she had deceived me. I said, \u2018You know well enough.\u2019\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat did she know?\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cHow was I to tell?\u201d replied Rogojin, with an angry laugh. \u201cI did my best to catch her tripping in Moscow, but did not succeed. However, I caught hold of her one day, and said: \u2018You are engaged to be married into a respectable family, and do you know what sort of a woman you are? _That\u2019s_ the sort of woman you are,\u2019 I said.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou told her that?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, go on.\u201d",
            "\u201cShe said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t even have you for a footman now, much less for a husband.\u2019 \u2018I shan\u2019t leave the house,\u2019 I said, \u2018so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 \u2018Then I shall call somebody and have you kicked out,\u2019 she cried. So then I rushed at her, and beat her till she was bruised all over.\u201d",
            "\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried the prince, aghast.",
            "\u201cI tell you it\u2019s true,\u201d said Rogojin quietly, but with eyes ablaze with passion.",
            "\u201cThen for a day and a half I neither slept, nor ate, nor drank, and would not leave her. I knelt at her feet: \u2018I shall die here,\u2019 I said, \u2018if you don\u2019t forgive me; and if you have me turned out, I shall drown myself; because, what should I be without you now?\u2019 She was like a madwoman all that day; now she would cry; now she would threaten me with a knife; now she would abuse me. She called in Zaleshoff and Keller, and showed me to them, shamed me in their presence. \u2018Let\u2019s all go to the theatre,\u2019 she says, \u2018and leave him here if he won\u2019t go\u2014it\u2019s not my business. They\u2019ll give you some tea, Parfen Semeonovitch, while I am away, for you must be hungry.\u2019 She came back from the theatre alone. \u2018Those cowards wouldn\u2019t come,\u2019 she said. \u2018They are afraid of you, and tried to frighten me, too. \u201cHe won\u2019t go away as he came,\u201d they said, \u201che\u2019ll cut your throat\u2014see if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Now, I shall go to my bedroom, and I shall not even lock my door, just to show you how much I am afraid of you. You must be shown that once for all. Did you have tea?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 I said, \u2018and I don\u2019t intend to.\u2019 \u2018Ha, ha! you are playing off your pride against your stomach! That sort of heroism doesn\u2019t sit well on you,\u2019 she said.",
            "\u201cWith that she did as she had said she would; she went to bed, and did not lock her door. In the morning she came out. \u2018Are you quite mad?\u2019 she said, sharply. \u2018Why, you\u2019ll die of hunger like this.\u2019 \u2018Forgive me,\u2019 I said. \u2018No, I won\u2019t, and I won\u2019t marry you. I\u2019ve said it. Surely you haven\u2019t sat in this chair all night without sleeping?\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep,\u2019 I said. \u2018H\u2019m! how sensible of you. And are you going to have no breakfast or dinner today?\u2019 \u2018I told you I wouldn\u2019t. Forgive me!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve no idea how unbecoming this sort of thing is to you,\u2019 she said, \u2018it\u2019s like putting a saddle on a cow\u2019s back. Do you think you are frightening me? My word, what a dreadful thing that you should sit here and eat no food! How terribly frightened I am!\u2019 She wasn\u2019t angry long, and didn\u2019t seem to remember my offence at all. I was surprised, for she is a vindictive, resentful woman\u2014but then I thought that perhaps she despised me too much to feel any resentment against me. And that\u2019s the truth.",
            "\u201cShe came up to me and said, \u2018Do you know who the Pope of Rome is?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve heard of him,\u2019 I said. \u2018I suppose you\u2019ve read the Universal History, Parfen Semeonovitch, haven\u2019t you?\u2019 she asked. \u2018I\u2019ve learned nothing at all,\u2019 I said. \u2018Then I\u2019ll lend it to you to read. You must know there was a Roman Pope once, and he was very angry with a certain Emperor; so the Emperor came and neither ate nor drank, but knelt before the Pope\u2019s palace till he should be forgiven. And what sort of vows do you think that Emperor was making during all those days on his knees? Stop, I\u2019ll read it to you!\u2019 Then she read me a lot of verses, where it said that the Emperor spent all the time vowing vengeance against the Pope. \u2018You don\u2019t mean to say you don\u2019t approve of the poem, Parfen Semeonovitch,\u2019 she says. \u2018All you have read out is perfectly true,\u2019 say I. \u2018Aha!\u2019 says she, \u2018you admit it\u2019s true, do you? And you are making vows to yourself that if I marry you, you will remind me of all this, and take it out of me.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 I say, \u2018perhaps I was thinking like that, and perhaps I was not. I\u2019m not thinking of anything just now.\u2019 \u2018What are your thoughts, then?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m thinking that when you rise from your chair and go past me, I watch you, and follow you with my eyes; if your dress does but rustle, my heart sinks; if you leave the room, I remember every little word and action, and what your voice sounded like, and what you said. I thought of nothing all last night, but sat here listening to your sleeping breath, and heard you move a little, twice.\u2019 \u2018And as for your attack upon me,\u2019 she says, \u2018I suppose you never once thought of _that?_\u2019 \u2018Perhaps I did think of it, and perhaps not,\u2019 I say. \u2018And what if I don\u2019t either forgive you or marry, you?\u2019 \u2018I tell you I shall go and drown myself.\u2019 \u2018H\u2019m!\u2019 she said, and then relapsed into silence. Then she got angry, and went out. \u2018I suppose you\u2019d murder me before you drowned yourself, though!\u2019 she cried as she left the room.",
            "\u201cAn hour later, she came to me again, looking melancholy. \u2018I will marry you, Parfen Semeonovitch,\u2019 she says, not because I\u2019m frightened of you, but because it\u2019s all the same to me how I ruin myself. And how can I do it better? Sit down; they\u2019ll bring you some dinner directly. And if I do marry you, I\u2019ll be a faithful wife to you\u2014you need not doubt that.\u2019 Then she thought a bit, and said, \u2018At all events, you are not a flunkey; at first, I thought you were no better than a flunkey.\u2019 And she arranged the wedding and fixed the day straight away on the spot.",
            "\u201cThen, in another week, she had run away again, and came here to Lebedeff\u2019s; and when I found her here, she said to me, \u2018I\u2019m not going to renounce you altogether, but I wish to put off the wedding a bit longer yet\u2014just as long as I like\u2014for I am still my own mistress; so you may wait, if you like.\u2019 That\u2019s how the matter stands between us now. What do you think of all this, Lef Nicolaievitch?\u201d",
            "\u201c\u2018What do you think of it yourself?\u201d replied the prince, looking sadly at Rogojin.",

            "The prince rose again, as if he would leave.",
            "\u201cAt all events, I shall not interfere with you!\u201d he murmured, as though making answer to some secret thought of his own.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what!\u201d cried Rogojin, and his eyes flashed fire. \u201cI can\u2019t understand your yielding her to me like this; I don\u2019t understand it. Have you given up loving her altogether? At first you suffered badly\u2014I know it\u2014I saw it. Besides, why did you come post-haste after us? Out of pity, eh? He, he, he!\u201d His mouth curved in a mocking smile.",

            "\u201cNo! I trust you\u2014but I can\u2019t understand. It seems to me that your pity is greater than my love.\u201d A hungry longing to speak his mind out seemed to flash in the man\u2019s eyes, combined with an intense anger.",
            "\u201cYour love is mingled with hatred, and therefore, when your love passes, there will be the greater misery,\u201d said the prince. \u201cI tell you this, Parfen\u2014\u201d",

            "\u201cYou\u2019ll hate her afterwards for all your present love, and for all the torment you are suffering on her account now. What seems to me the most extraordinary thing is, that she can again consent to marry you, after all that has passed between you. When I heard the news yesterday, I could hardly bring myself to believe it. Why, she has run twice from you, from the very altar rails, as it were. She must have some presentiment of evil. What can she want with you now? Your money? Nonsense! Besides, I should think you must have made a fairly large hole in your fortune already. Surely it is not because she is so very anxious to find a husband? She could find many a one besides yourself. Anyone would be better than you, because you will murder her, and I feel sure she must know that but too well by now. Is it because you love her so passionately? Indeed, that may be it. I have heard that there are women who want just that kind of love... but still...\u201d The prince paused, reflectively.",
            "\u201cWhat are you grinning at my father\u2019s portrait again for?\u201d asked Rogojin, suddenly. He was carefully observing every change in the expression of the prince\u2019s face.",
            "\u201cI smiled because the idea came into my head that if it were not for this unhappy passion of yours you might have, and would have, become just such a man as your father, and that very quickly, too. You\u2019d have settled down in this house of yours with some silent and obedient wife. You would have spoken rarely, trusted no one, heeded no one, and thought of nothing but making money.\u201d",
            "\u201cLaugh away! She said exactly the same, almost word for word, when she saw my father\u2019s portrait. It\u2019s remarkable how entirely you and she are at one now-a-days.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, has she been here?\u201d asked the prince with curiosity.",
            "\u201cYes! She looked long at the portrait and asked all about my father. \u2018You\u2019d be just such another,\u2019 she said at last, and laughed. \u2018You have such strong passions, Parfen,\u2019 she said, \u2018that they\u2019d have taken you to Siberia in no time if you had not, luckily, intelligence as well. For you have a good deal of intelligence.\u2019 (She said this\u2014believe it or not. The first time I ever heard anything of that sort from her.) \u2018You\u2019d soon have thrown up all this rowdyism that you indulge in now, and you\u2019d have settled down to quiet, steady money-making, because you have little education; and here you\u2019d have stayed just like your father before you. And you\u2019d have loved your money so that you\u2019d amass not two million, like him, but ten million; and you\u2019d have died of hunger on your money bags to finish up with, for you carry everything to extremes.\u2019 There, that\u2019s exactly word for word as she said it to me. She never talked to me like that before. She always talks nonsense and laughs when she\u2019s with me. We went all over this old house together. \u2018I shall change all this,\u2019 I said, \u2018or else I\u2019ll buy a new house for the wedding.\u2019 \u2018No, no!\u2019 she said, \u2018don\u2019t touch anything; leave it all as it is; I shall live with your mother when I marry you.\u2019",
            "\u201cI took her to see my mother, and she was as respectful and kind as though she were her own daughter. Mother has been almost demented ever since father died\u2014she\u2019s an old woman. She sits and bows from her chair to everyone she sees. If you left her alone and didn\u2019t feed her for three days, I don\u2019t believe she would notice it. Well, I took her hand, and I said, \u2018Give your blessing to this lady, mother, she\u2019s going to be my wife.\u2019 So Nastasia kissed mother\u2019s hand with great feeling. \u2018She must have suffered terribly, hasn\u2019t she?\u2019 she said. She saw this book here lying before me. \u2018What! have you begun to read Russian history?\u2019 she asked. She told me once in Moscow, you know, that I had better get Solovieff\u2019s Russian History and read it, because I knew nothing. \u2018That\u2019s good,\u2019 she said, \u2018you go on like that, reading books. I\u2019ll make you a list myself of the books you ought to read first\u2014shall I?\u2019 She had never once spoken to me like this before; it was the first time I felt I could breathe before her like a living creature.\u201d",

I said just now that I considered it extraordinary that she could still be ready to marry you. Well, though I cannot yet understand it, I feel sure she must have some good reason, or she wouldn\u2019t do it. She is sure of your love; but besides that, she must attribute _something_ else to you\u2014some good qualities, otherwise the thing would not be. What you have just said confirms my words. You say yourself that she found it possible to speak to you quite differently from her usual manner. You are suspicious, you know, and jealous, therefore when anything annoying happens to you, you exaggerate its significance. Of course, of course, she does not think so ill of you as you say. Why, if she did, she would simply be walking to death by drowning or by the knife, with her eyes wide open, when she married you. It is impossible! As if anybody would go to their death deliberately!\u201d",

Let\u2019s have the wedding quickly!\u2019 and fixes the day, and seems in a hurry for it, and when it begins to come near she feels frightened; or else some other idea gets into her head\u2014goodness knows! you\u2019ve seen her\u2014you know how she goes on\u2014laughing and crying and raving! There\u2019s nothing extraordinary about her having run away from you! She ran away because she found out how dearly she loved you. She could not bear to be near you. You said just now that I had found her at Moscow, when she ran away from you. I didn\u2019t do anything of the sort; she came to me herself, straight from you. \u2018Name the day\u2014I\u2019m ready!\u2019 she said. \u2018Let\u2019s have some champagne, and go and hear the gipsies sing!\u2019 I tell you she\u2019d have thrown herself into the water long ago if it were not for me!

One morning I met a man in the train, and made acquaintance with him at once. I had often heard of him as a very learned man, but an atheist; and I was very glad of the opportunity of conversing with so eminent and clever a person. He doesn\u2019t believe in God, and he talked a good deal about it, but all the while it appeared to me that he was speaking _outside the subject_. And it has always struck me, both in speaking to such men and in reading their books, that they do not seem really to be touching on that at all, though on the surface they may appear to do so. I told him this, but I dare say I did not clearly express what I meant, for he could not understand me.",
            "\u201cThat same evening I stopped at a small provincial hotel, and it so happened that a dreadful murder had been committed there the night before, and everybody was talking about it. Two peasants\u2014elderly men and old friends\u2014had had tea together there the night before, and were to occupy the same bedroom. They were not drunk but one of them had noticed for the first time that his friend possessed a silver watch which he was wearing on a chain. He was by no means a thief, and was, as peasants go, a rich man; but this watch so fascinated him that he could not restrain himself. He took a knife, and when his friend turned his back, he came up softly behind, raised his eyes to heaven, crossed himself, and saying earnestly\u2014\u2018God forgive me, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u2019 he cut his friend\u2019s throat like a sheep, and took the watch.\u201d",

That beats anything!\u201d he cried convulsively, panting for breath. \u201cOne is an absolute unbeliever; the other is such a thorough-going believer that he murders his friend to the tune of a prayer! Oh, prince, prince, that\u2019s too good for anything! You can\u2019t have invented it. It\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve heard!\u201d",
            "\u201cNext morning I went out for a stroll through the town,\u201d continued the prince, so soon as Rogojin was a little quieter, though his laughter still burst out at intervals, \u201cand soon observed a drunken-looking soldier staggering about the pavement. He came up to me and said, \u2018Buy my silver cross, sir! You shall have it for fourpence\u2014it\u2019s real silver.\u2019 I looked, and there he held a cross, just taken off his own neck, evidently, a large tin one, made after the Byzantine pattern. I fished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck, and I could see by his face that he was as pleased as he could be at the thought that he had succeeded in cheating a foolish gentleman, and away he went to drink the value of his cross. At that time everything that I saw made a tremendous impression upon me. I had understood nothing about Russia before, and had only vague and fantastic memories of it. So I thought, \u2018I will wait awhile before I condemn this Judas. Only God knows what may be hidden in the hearts of drunkards.\u2019",
            "\u201cWell, I went homewards, and near the hotel I came across a poor woman, carrying a child\u2014a baby of some six weeks old. The mother was quite a girl herself. The baby was smiling up at her, for the first time in its life, just at that moment; and while I watched the woman she suddenly crossed herself, oh, so devoutly! \u2018What is it, my good woman?\u2019 I asked her. (I was never but asking questions then!) \u2018Exactly as is a mother\u2019s joy when her baby smiles for the first time into her eyes, so is God\u2019s joy when one of His children turns and prays to Him for the first time, with all his heart!\u2019 This is what that poor woman said to me, almost word for word; and such a deep, refined, truly religious thought it was\u2014a thought in which the whole essence of Christianity was expressed in one flash\u2014that is, the recognition of God as our Father, and of God\u2019s joy in men as His own children, which is the chief idea of Christ. She was a simple country-woman\u2014a mother, it\u2019s true\u2014and perhaps, who knows, she may have been the wife of the drunken soldier!",
            "\u201cListen, Parfen; you put a question to me just now. This is my reply. The essence of religious feeling has nothing to do with reason, or atheism, or crime, or acts of any kind\u2014it has nothing to do with these things\u2014and never had. There is something besides all this, something which the arguments of the atheists can never touch. But the principal thing, and the conclusion of my argument, is that this is most clearly seen in the heart of a Russian. This is a conviction which I have gained while I have been in this Russia of ours. Yes, Parfen! there is work to be done; there is work to be done in this Russian world! Remember what talks we used to have in Moscow! And I never wished to come here at all; and I never thought to meet you like this, Parfen! Well, well\u2014good-bye\u2014good-bye! God be with you!\u201d",

            "Parfen was silent. With sad surprise the prince observed that the look of distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left his newly-adopted brother\u2019s face. At moments, at all events, it showed itself but too plainly,",
            "At last Rogojin took the prince\u2019s hand, and stood so for some moments, as though he could not make up his mind. Then he drew him along, murmuring almost inaudibly,",
            "\u201cCome!\u201d",
            "They stopped on the landing, and rang the bell at a door opposite to Parfen\u2019s own lodging.",
            "An old woman opened to them and bowed low to Parfen, who asked her some questions hurriedly, but did not wait to hear her answer. He led the prince on through several dark, cold-looking rooms, spotlessly clean, with white covers over all the furniture.",
            "Without the ceremony of knocking, Parfen entered a small apartment, furnished like a drawing-room, but with a polished mahogany partition dividing one half of it from what was probably a bedroom. In one corner of this room sat an old woman in an arm-chair, close to the stove. She did not look very old, and her face was a pleasant, round one; but she was white-haired and, as one could detect at the first glance, quite in her second childhood. She wore a black woollen dress, with a black handkerchief round her neck and shoulders, and a white cap with black ribbons. Her feet were raised on a footstool. Beside her sat another old woman, also dressed in mourning, and silently knitting a stocking; this was evidently a companion. They both looked as though they never broke the silence. The first old woman, so soon as she saw Rogojin and the prince, smiled and bowed courteously several times, in token of her gratification at their visit.",
            "\u201cMother,\u201d said Rogojin, kissing her hand, \u201chere is my great friend, Prince Muishkin; we have exchanged crosses; he was like a real brother to me at Moscow at one time, and did a great deal for me. Bless him, mother, as you would bless your own son. Wait a moment, let me arrange your hands for you.\u201d",
            "But the old lady, before Parfen had time to touch her, raised her right hand, and, with three fingers held up, devoutly made the sign of the cross three times over the prince. She then nodded her head kindly at him once more.",
            "\u201cThere, come along, Lef Nicolaievitch; that\u2019s all I brought you here for,\u201d said Rogojin.",
            "When they reached the stairs again he added:",
            "\u201cShe understood nothing of what I said to her, and did not know what I wanted her to do, and yet she blessed you; that shows she wished to do so herself. Well, goodbye; it\u2019s time you went, and I must go too.\u201d",
            "He opened his own door.",
            "\u201cWell, let me at least embrace you and say goodbye, you strange fellow!\u201d cried the prince, looking with gentle reproach at Rogojin, and advancing towards him. But the latter had hardly raised his arms when he dropped them again. He could not make up his mind to it; he turned away from the prince in order to avoid looking at him. He could not embrace him.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d he muttered, indistinctly, \u201cthough I have taken your cross, I shall not murder you for your watch.\u201d So saying, he laughed suddenly, and strangely. Then in a moment his face became transfigured; he grew deadly white, his lips trembled, his eyes burned like fire. He stretched out his arms and held the prince tightly to him, and said in a strangled voice:",
            "\u201cWell, take her! It\u2019s Fate! She\u2019s yours. I surrender her.... Remember Rogojin!\u201d And pushing the prince from him, without looking back at him, he hurriedly entered his own flat, and banged the door. "

He entered a confectioner\u2019s shop to rest, once. He was in a state of nervous excitement and perturbation; he noticed nothing and no one; and he felt a craving for solitude, to be alone with his thoughts and his emotions, and to give himself up to them passively. He loathed the idea of trying to answer the questions that would rise up in his heart and mind. \u201cI am not to blame for all this,\u201d he thought to himself, half unconsciously.",

He was about to take his place in a carriage, when he suddenly threw away his ticket and came out again, disturbed and thoughtful. A few moments later, in the street, he recalled something that had bothered him all the afternoon. He caught himself engaged in a strange occupation which he now recollected he had taken up at odd moments for the last few hours\u2014it was looking about all around him for something, he did not know what. He had forgotten it for a while, half an hour or so, and now, suddenly, the uneasy search had recommenced.",
            "But he had hardly become conscious of this curious phenomenon, when another recollection suddenly swam through his brain, interesting him for the moment, exceedingly. He remembered that the last time he had been engaged in looking around him for the unknown something, he was standing before a cutler\u2019s shop, in the window of which were exposed certain goods for sale. He was extremely anxious now to discover whether this shop and these goods really existed, or whether the whole thing had been a hallucination.",
            "He felt in a very curious condition today, a condition similar to that which had preceded his fits in bygone years.",
            "He remembered that at such times he had been particularly absentminded, and could not discriminate between objects and persons unless he concentrated special attention upon them.",
            "He remembered seeing something in the window marked at sixty copecks. Therefore, if the shop existed and if this object were really in the window, it would prove that he had been able to concentrate his attention on this article at a moment when, as a general rule, his absence of mind would have been too great to admit of any such concentration; in fact, very shortly after he had left the railway station in such a state of agitation.",
            "So he walked back looking about him for the shop, and his heart beat with intolerable impatience. Ah! here was the very shop, and there was the article marked \u201c60 cop.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s sixty copecks, he thought, and certainly worth no more. This idea amused him and he laughed.",
            "But it was a hysterical laugh; he was feeling terribly oppressed. He remembered clearly that just here, standing before this window, he had suddenly turned round, just as earlier in the day he had turned and found the dreadful eyes of Rogojin fixed upon him. Convinced, therefore, that in this respect at all events he had been under no delusion, he left the shop and went on.",
            "This must be thought out; it was clear that there had been no hallucination at the station then, either; something had actually happened to him, on both occasions; there was no doubt of it. But again a loathing for all mental exertion overmastered him; he would not think it out now, he would put it off and think of something else. He remembered that during his epileptic fits, or rather immediately preceding them, he had always experienced a moment or two when his whole heart, and mind, and body seemed to wake up to vigour and light; when he became filled with joy and hope, and all his anxieties seemed to be swept away for ever; these moments were but presentiments, as it were, of the one final second (it was never more than a second) in which the fit came upon him. That second, of course, was inexpressible. When his attack was over, and the prince reflected on his symptoms, he used to say to himself: \u201cThese moments, short as they are, when I feel such extreme consciousness of myself, and consequently more of life than at other times, are due only to the disease\u2014to the sudden rupture of normal conditions. Therefore they are not really a higher kind of life, but a lower.\u201d This reasoning, however, seemed to end in a paradox, and lead to the further consideration:\u2014\u201cWhat matter though it be only disease, an abnormal tension of the brain, if when I recall and analyze the moment, it seems to have been one of harmony and beauty in the highest degree\u2014an instant of deepest sensation, overflowing with unbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and completest life?\u201d Vague though this sounds, it was perfectly comprehensible to Muishkin, though he knew that it was but a feeble expression of his sensations.",
            "That there was, indeed, beauty and harmony in those abnormal moments, that they really contained the highest synthesis of life, he could not doubt, nor even admit the possibility of doubt. He felt that they were not analogous to the fantastic and unreal dreams due to intoxication by hashish, opium or wine. Of that he could judge, when the attack was over. These instants were characterized\u2014to define it in a word\u2014by an intense quickening of the sense of personality. Since, in the last conscious moment preceding the attack, he could say to himself, with full understanding of his words: \u201cI would give my whole life for this one instant,\u201d then doubtless to him it really was worth a lifetime. For the rest, he thought the dialectical part of his argument of little worth; he saw only too clearly that the result of these ecstatic moments was stupefaction, mental darkness, idiocy. No argument was possible on that point. His conclusion, his estimate of the \u201cmoment,\u201d doubtless contained some error, yet the reality of the sensation troubled him. What\u2019s more unanswerable than a fact? And this fact had occurred. The prince had confessed unreservedly to himself that the feeling of intense beatitude in that crowded moment made the moment worth a lifetime. \u201cI feel then,\u201d he said one day to Rogojin in Moscow, \u201cI feel then as if I understood those amazing words\u2014\u2018There shall be no more time.\u2019\u201d And he added with a smile: \u201cNo doubt the epileptic Mahomet refers to that same moment when he says that he visited all the dwellings of Allah, in less time than was needed to empty his pitcher of water.\u201d Yes, he had often met Rogojin in Moscow, and many were the subjects they discussed. \u201cHe told me I had been a brother to him,\u201d thought the prince. \u201cHe said so today, for the first time.\u201d",
            "He was sitting in the Summer Garden on a seat under a tree, and his mind dwelt on the matter. It was about seven o\u2019clock, and the place was empty. The stifling atmosphere foretold a storm, and the prince felt a certain charm in the contemplative mood which possessed him. He found pleasure, too, in gazing at the exterior objects around him. All the time he was trying to forget some thing, to escape from some idea that haunted him; but melancholy thoughts came back, though he would so willingly have escaped from them. He remembered suddenly how he had been talking to the waiter, while he dined, about a recently committed murder which the whole town was discussing, and as he thought of it something strange came over him. He was seized all at once by a violent desire, almost a temptation, against which he strove in vain.",
            "He jumped up and walked off as fast as he could towards the \u201cPetersburg Side.\u201d [One of the quarters of St. Petersburg.] He had asked someone, a little while before, to show him which was the Petersburg Side, on the banks of the Neva. He had not gone there, however; and he knew very well that it was of no use to go now, for he would certainly not find Lebedeff\u2019s relation at home. He had the address, but she must certainly have gone to Pavlofsk, or Colia would have let him know. If he were to go now, it would merely be out of curiosity, but a sudden, new idea had come into his head.",
            "However, it was something to move on and know where he was going. A minute later he was still moving on, but without knowing anything. He could no longer think out his new idea. He tried to take an interest in all he saw; in the sky, in the Neva. He spoke to some children he met. He felt his epileptic condition becoming more and more developed. The evening was very close; thunder was heard some way off.",
            "The prince was haunted all that day by the face of Lebedeff\u2019s nephew whom he had seen for the first time that morning, just as one is haunted at times by some persistent musical refrain. By a curious association of ideas, the young man always appeared as the murderer of whom Lebedeff had spoken when introducing him to Muishkin. Yes, he had read something about the murder, and that quite recently. Since he came to Russia, he had heard many stories of this kind, and was interested in them. His conversation with the waiter, an hour ago, chanced to be on the subject of this murder of the Zemarins, and the latter had agreed with him about it. He thought of the waiter again, and decided that he was no fool, but a steady, intelligent man: though, said he to himself, \u201cGod knows what he may really be; in a country with which one is unfamiliar it is difficult to understand the people one meets.\u201d He was beginning to have a passionate faith in the Russian soul, however, and what discoveries he had made in the last six months, what unexpected discoveries! But every soul is a mystery, and depths of mystery lie in the soul of a Russian. He had been intimate with Rogojin, for example, and a brotherly friendship had sprung up between them\u2014yet did he really know him? What chaos and ugliness fills the world at times! What a self-satisfied rascal is that nephew of Lebedeff\u2019s! \u201cBut what am I thinking,\u201d continued the prince to himself. \u201cCan he really have committed that crime? Did he kill those six persons? I seem to be confusing things... how strange it all is.... My head goes round... And Lebedeff\u2019s daughter\u2014how sympathetic and charming her face was as she held the child in her arms! What an innocent look and child-like laugh she had! It is curious that I had forgotten her until now. I expect Lebedeff adores her\u2014and I really believe, when I think of it, that as sure as two and two make four, he is fond of that nephew, too!\u201d",
            "Well, why should he judge them so hastily! Could he really say what they were, after one short visit? Even Lebedeff seemed an enigma today. Did he expect to find him so? He had never seen him like that before. Lebedeff and the Comtesse du Barry! Good Heavens! If Rogojin should really kill someone, it would not, at any rate, be such a senseless, chaotic affair. A knife made to a special pattern, and six people killed in a kind of delirium. But Rogojin also had a knife made to a special pattern. Can it be that Rogojin wishes to murder anyone? The prince began to tremble violently. \u201cIt is a crime on my part to imagine anything so base, with such cynical frankness.\u201d His face reddened with shame at the thought; and then there came across him as in a flash the memory of the incidents at the Pavlofsk station, and at the other station in the morning; and the question asked him by Rogojin about _the eyes_ and Rogojin\u2019s cross, that he was even now wearing; and the benediction of Rogojin\u2019s mother; and his embrace on the darkened staircase\u2014that last supreme renunciation\u2014and now, to find himself full of this new \u201cidea,\u201d staring into shop-windows, and looking round for things\u2014how base he was!",
            "Despair overmastered his soul; he would not go on, he would go back to his hotel; he even turned and went the other way; but a moment after he changed his mind again and went on in the old direction.",
            "Why, here he was on the Petersburg Side already, quite close to the house! Where was his \u201cidea\u201d? He was marching along without it now. Yes, his malady was coming back, it was clear enough; all this gloom and heaviness, all these \u201cideas,\u201d were nothing more nor less than a fit coming on; perhaps he would have a fit this very day.",
            "But just now all the gloom and darkness had fled, his heart felt full of joy and hope, there was no such thing as doubt. And yes, he hadn\u2019t seen her for so long; he really must see her. He wished he could meet Rogojin; he would take his hand, and they would go to her together. His heart was pure, he was no rival of Parfen\u2019s. Tomorrow, he would go and tell him that he had seen her. Why, he had only come for the sole purpose of seeing her, all the way from Moscow! Perhaps she might be here still, who knows? She might not have gone away to Pavlofsk yet.",
            "Yes, all this must be put straight and above-board, there must be no more passionate renouncements, such as Rogojin\u2019s. It must all be clear as day. Cannot Rogojin\u2019s soul bear the light? He said he did not love her with sympathy and pity; true, he added that \u201cyour pity is greater than my love,\u201d but he was not quite fair on himself there. Kin! Rogojin reading a book\u2014wasn\u2019t that sympathy beginning? Did it not show that he comprehended his relations with her? And his story of waiting day and night for her forgiveness? That didn\u2019t look quite like passion alone.",
            "And as to her face, could it inspire nothing but passion? Could her face inspire passion at all now? Oh, it inspired suffering, grief, overwhelming grief of the soul! A poignant, agonizing memory swept over the prince\u2019s heart.",
            "Yes, agonizing. He remembered how he had suffered that first day when he thought he observed in her the symptoms of madness. He had almost fallen into despair. How could he have lost his hold upon her when she ran away from him to Rogojin? He ought to have run after her himself, rather than wait for news as he had done. Can Rogojin have failed to observe, up to now, that she is mad? Rogojin attributes her strangeness to other causes, to passion! What insane jealousy! What was it he had hinted at in that suggestion of his? The prince suddenly blushed, and shuddered to his very heart.",
            "But why recall all this? There was insanity on both sides. For him, the prince, to love this woman with passion, was unthinkable. It would be cruel and inhuman. Yes. Rogojin is not fair to himself; he has a large heart; he has aptitude for sympathy. When he learns the truth, and finds what a pitiable being is this injured, broken, half-insane creature, he will forgive her all the torment she has caused him. He will become her slave, her brother, her friend. Compassion will teach even Rogojin, it will show him how to reason. Compassion is the chief law of human existence. Oh, how guilty he felt towards Rogojin! And, for a few warm, hasty words spoken in Moscow, Parfen had called him \u201cbrother,\u201d while he\u2014but no, this was delirium! It would all come right! That gloomy Parfen had implied that his faith was waning; he must suffer dreadfully. He said he liked to look at that picture; it was not that he liked it, but he felt the need of looking at it. Rogojin was not merely a passionate soul; he was a fighter. He was fighting for the restoration of his dying faith. He must have something to hold on to and believe, and someone to believe in. What a strange picture that of Holbein\u2019s is! Why, this is the street, and here\u2019s the house, No. 16.",
            "The prince rang the bell, and asked for Nastasia Philipovna. The lady of the house came out, and stated that Nastasia had gone to stay with Daria Alexeyevna at Pavlofsk, and might be there some days.",
            "Madame Filisoff was a little woman of forty, with a cunning face, and crafty, piercing eyes. When, with an air of mystery, she asked her visitor\u2019s name, he refused at first to answer, but in a moment he changed his mind, and left strict instructions that it should be given to Nastasia Philipovna. The urgency of his request seemed to impress Madame Filisoff, and she put on a knowing expression, as if to say, \u201cYou need not be afraid, I quite understand.\u201d The prince\u2019s name evidently was a great surprise to her. He stood and looked absently at her for a moment, then turned, and took the road back to his hotel. But he went away not as he came. A great change had suddenly come over him. He went blindly forward; his knees shook under him; he was tormented by \u201cideas\u201d; his lips were blue, and trembled with a feeble, meaningless smile. His demon was upon him once more.",
            "What had happened to him? Why was his brow clammy with drops of moisture, his knees shaking beneath him, and his soul oppressed with a cold gloom? Was it because he had just seen these dreadful eyes again? Why, he had left the Summer Garden on purpose to see them; that had been his \u201cidea.\u201d He had wished to assure himself that he would see them once more at that house. Then why was he so overwhelmed now, having seen them as he expected? just as though he had not expected to see them! Yes, they were the very same eyes; and no doubt about it. The same that he had seen in the crowd that morning at the station, the same that he had surprised in Rogojin\u2019s rooms some hours later, when the latter had replied to his inquiry with a sneering laugh, \u201cWell, whose eyes were they?\u201d Then for the third time they had appeared just as he was getting into the train on his way to see Aglaya. He had had a strong impulse to rush up to Rogojin, and repeat his words of the morning \u201cWhose eyes are they?\u201d Instead he had fled from the station, and knew nothing more, until he found himself gazing into the window of a cutler\u2019s shop, and wondering if a knife with a staghorn handle would cost more than sixty copecks. And as the prince sat dreaming in the Summer Garden under a lime-tree, a wicked demon had come and whispered in his car: \u201cRogojin has been spying upon you and watching you all the morning in a frenzy of desperation. When he finds you have not gone to Pavlofsk\u2014a terrible discovery for him\u2014he will surely go at once to that house in Petersburg Side, and watch for you there, although only this morning you gave your word of honour not to see _her_, and swore that you had not come to Petersburg for that purpose.\u201d And thereupon the prince had hastened off to that house, and what was there in the fact that he had met Rogojin there? He had only seen a wretched, suffering creature, whose state of mind was gloomy and miserable, but most comprehensible. In the morning Rogojin had seemed to be trying to keep out of the way; but at the station this afternoon he had stood out, he had concealed himself, indeed, less than the prince himself; at the house, now, he had stood fifty yards off on the other side of the road, with folded hands, watching, plainly in view and apparently desirous of being seen. He had stood there like an accuser, like a judge, not like a\u2014a what?",
            "And why had not the prince approached him and spoken to him, instead of turning away and pretending he had seen nothing, although their eyes met? (Yes, their eyes had met, and they had looked at each other.) Why, he had himself wished to take Rogojin by the hand and go in together, he had himself determined to go to him on the morrow and tell him that he had seen her, he had repudiated the demon as he walked to the house, and his heart had been full of joy.",
            "Was there something in the whole aspect of the man, today, sufficient to justify the prince\u2019s terror, and the awful suspicions of his demon? Something seen, but indescribable, which filled him with dreadful presentiments? Yes, he was convinced of it\u2014convinced of what? (Oh, how mean and hideous of him to feel this conviction, this presentiment! How he blamed himself for it!) \u201cSpeak if you dare, and tell me, what is the presentiment?\u201d he repeated to himself, over and over again. \u201cPut it into words, speak out clearly and distinctly. Oh, miserable coward that I am!\u201d The prince flushed with shame for his own baseness. \u201cHow shall I ever look this man in the face again? My God, what a day! And what a nightmare, what a nightmare!\u201d",
            "There was a moment, during this long, wretched walk back from the Petersburg Side, when the prince felt an irresistible desire to go straight to Rogojin\u2019s, wait for him, embrace him with tears of shame and contrition, and tell him of his distrust, and finish with it\u2014once for all.",
            "But here he was back at his hotel.",
            "How often during the day he had thought of this hotel with loathing\u2014its corridor, its rooms, its stairs. How he had dreaded coming back to it, for some reason.",
            "\u201cWhat a regular old woman I am today,\u201d he had said to himself each time, with annoyance. \u201cI believe in every foolish presentiment that comes into my head.\u201d",
            "He stopped for a moment at the door; a great flush of shame came over him. \u201cI am a coward, a wretched coward,\u201d he said, and moved forward again; but once more he paused.",
            "Among all the incidents of the day, one recurred to his mind to the exclusion of the rest; although now that his self-control was regained, and he was no longer under the influence of a nightmare, he was able to think of it calmly. It concerned the knife on Rogojin\u2019s table. \u201cWhy should not Rogojin have as many knives on his table as he chooses?\u201d thought the prince, wondering at his suspicions, as he had done when he found himself looking into the cutler\u2019s window. \u201cWhat could it have to do with me?\u201d he said to himself again, and stopped as if rooted to the ground by a kind of paralysis of limb such as attacks people under the stress of some humiliating recollection.",
            "The doorway was dark and gloomy at any time; but just at this moment it was rendered doubly so by the fact that the thunder-storm had just broken, and the rain was coming down in torrents.",
            "And in the semi-darkness the prince distinguished a man standing close to the stairs, apparently waiting.",
            "There was nothing particularly significant in the fact that a man was standing back in the doorway, waiting to come out or go upstairs; but the prince felt an irresistible conviction that he knew this man, and that it was Rogojin. The man moved on up the stairs; a moment later the prince passed up them, too. His heart froze within him. \u201cIn a minute or two I shall know all,\u201d he thought.",
            "The staircase led to the first and second corridors of the hotel, along which lay the guests\u2019 bedrooms. As is often the case in Petersburg houses, it was narrow and very dark, and turned around a massive stone column.",
            "On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about half a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. He would pass by quickly and not look. He took a step forward, but could bear the uncertainty no longer and turned his head.",
            "The eyes\u2014the same two eyes\u2014met his! The man concealed in the niche had also taken a step forward. For one second they stood face to face.",
            "Suddenly the prince caught the man by the shoulder and twisted him round towards the light, so that he might see his face more clearly.",
            "Rogojin\u2019s eyes flashed, and a smile of insanity distorted his countenance. His right hand was raised, and something glittered in it. The prince did not think of trying to stop it. All he could remember afterwards was that he seemed to have called out:",
            "\u201cParfen! I won\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
            "Next moment something appeared to burst open before him: a wonderful inner light illuminated his soul. This lasted perhaps half a second, yet he distinctly remembered hearing the beginning of the wail, the strange, dreadful wail, which burst from his lips of its own accord, and which no effort of will on his part could suppress.",
            "Next moment he was absolutely unconscious; black darkness blotted out everything.",
            "He had fallen in an epileptic fit.",
            "As is well known, these fits occur instantaneously. The face, especially the eyes, become terribly disfigured, convulsions seize the limbs, a terrible cry breaks from the sufferer, a wail from which everything human seems to be blotted out, so that it is impossible to believe that the man who has just fallen is the same who emitted the dreadful cry. It seems more as though some other being, inside the stricken one, had cried. Many people have borne witness to this impression; and many cannot behold an epileptic fit without a feeling of mysterious terror and dread.",
            "Such a feeling, we must suppose, overtook Rogojin at this moment, and saved the prince\u2019s life. Not knowing that it was a fit, and seeing his victim disappear head foremost into the darkness, hearing his head strike the stone steps below with a crash, Rogojin rushed downstairs, skirting the body, and flung himself headlong out of the hotel, like a raving madman.",
            "The prince\u2019s body slipped convulsively down the steps till it rested at the bottom. Very soon, in five minutes or so, he was discovered, and a crowd collected around him.",
            "A pool of blood on the steps near his head gave rise to grave fears. Was it a case of accident, or had there been a crime? It was, however, soon recognized as a case of epilepsy, and identification and proper measures for restoration followed one another, owing to a fortunate circumstance. Colia Ivolgin had come back to his hotel about seven o\u2019clock, owing to a sudden impulse which made him refuse to dine at the Epanchins\u2019, and, finding a note from the prince awaiting him, had sped away to the latter\u2019s address. Arrived there, he ordered a cup of tea and sat sipping it in the coffee-room. While there he heard excited whispers of someone just found at the bottom of the stairs in a fit; upon which he had hurried to the spot, with a presentiment of evil, and at once recognized the prince.",
            "The sufferer was immediately taken to his room, and though he partially regained consciousness, he lay long in a semi-dazed condition.",
            "The doctor stated that there was no danger to be apprehended from the wound on the head, and as soon as the prince could understand what was going on around him, Colia hired a carriage and took him away to Lebedeff\u2019s. There he was received with much cordiality, and the departure to the country was hastened on his account. Three days later they were all at Pavlofsk. "
        ],
        "VI.": [
            "A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs, stood on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees gave the house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought it, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to their number. When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the villa and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the street to enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the rent to be demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound.",
            "This country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of physical and mental exhaustion. On the day that they left for Pavlofsk, that is the day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in reality he felt very far from it. The faces of those around him for the last three days had made a pleasant impression. He was pleased to see, not only Colia, who had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff himself and all the family, except the nephew, who had left the house. He was also glad to receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before leaving St. Petersburg.",
            "It was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several people called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah. Gania was the first to arrive. He had grown so pale and thin that the prince could hardly recognize him. Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were rusticating in the neighbourhood. As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely budged from Lebedeff\u2019s house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with him. Lebedeff did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and to prevent him from invading the prince\u2019s quarters. He chatted with him confidentially, so that they might have been taken for old friends. During those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently held long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument on deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He seemed as if he could not do without the general. But it was not only Ardalion Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the prince\u2019s way. Since they had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same. Upon the pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in isolation, and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal. Lebedeff stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they attempted to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was excepted.",
            "\u201cThey will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy; besides it is not proper for them,\u201d he declared at last, in answer to a direct question from the prince.",
            "\u201cWhy on earth not?\u201d asked the latter. \u201cReally, you know, you are making yourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this. I get bored all by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on my nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out in the mysterious way you do.\u201d",
            "It was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone else from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the prince\u2019s room himself. He invariably began by opening the door a crack and peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped; then he would creep softly up to the arm-chair, sometimes making Muishkin jump by his sudden appearance. He always asked if the patient wanted anything, and when the latter replied that he only wanted to be left in peace, he would turn away obediently and make for the door on tip-toe, with deprecatory gestures to imply that he had only just looked in, that he would not speak a word, and would go away and not intrude again; which did not prevent him from reappearing in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Colia had free access to the prince, at which Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant. He would listen at the door for half an hour at a time while the two were talking. Colia found this out, and naturally told the prince of his discovery.",
            "\u201cDo you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and key like this?\u201d said the prince to Lebedeff. \u201cIn the country, at least, I intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean to see whom I like, and go where I please.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, of course,\u201d replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands.",
            "The prince looked him sternly up and down.",
            "\u201cWell, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that you had at the head of your bed with you here?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I left it where it was.\u201d",
            "\u201cImpossible!\u201d",
            "\u201cIt cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so firmly fixed.\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps you have one like it here?\u201d",
            "\u201cI have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I bought this house.\u201d",
            "\u201cAh! What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?\u201d",
            "\u201cThe-the general. I would not let him in; there is no need for him to visit you, prince... I have the deepest esteem for him, he is a\u2014a great man. You don\u2019t believe it? Well, you will see, and yet, most excellent prince, you had much better not receive him.\u201d",
            "\u201cMay I ask why? and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem as if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come near me?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am vile, vile; I know it!\u201d cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a contrite air. \u201cBut will not the general be too hospitable for you?\u201d",
            "\u201cToo hospitable?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes. First, he proposes to come and live in my house. Well and good; but he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the family. We have talked over our respective relations several times, and discovered that we are connected by marriage. It seems also that you are a sort of nephew on his mother\u2019s side; he was explaining it to me again only yesterday. If you are his nephew, it follows that I must also be a relation of yours, most excellent prince. Never mind about that, it is only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his life, from the day he was made an ensign to the 11th of last June, he has entertained at least two hundred guests at his table every day. Finally, he went so far as to say that they never rose from the table; they dined, supped, and had tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch. This went on for thirty years without a break; there was barely time to change the table-cloth; directly one person left, another took his place. On feast-days he entertained as many as three hundred guests, and they numbered seven hundred on the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the Russian Empire. It amounts to a passion with him; it makes one uneasy to hear of it. It is terrible to have to entertain people who do things on such a scale. That is why I wonder whether such a man is not too hospitable for you and me.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut you seem to be on the best of terms with him?\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite fraternal\u2014I look upon it as a joke. Let us be brothers-in-law, it is all the same to me,\u2014rather an honour than not. But in spite of the two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary of the Russian Empire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man. I am quite sincere. You said just now that I always looked as if I was going to tell you a secret; you are right. I have a secret to tell you: a certain person has just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret interview with you.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy should it be secret? Not at all; I will call on her myself tomorrow.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, oh no!\u201d cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; \u201cif she is afraid, it is not for the reason you think. By the way, do you know that the monster comes every day to inquire after your health?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou must have no suspicions, none whatever,\u201d said Lebedeff quickly. \u201cI only want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him, but of something quite, quite different.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat on earth is she afraid of, then? Tell me plainly, without any more beating about the bush,\u201d said the prince, exasperated by the other\u2019s mysterious grimaces.",
            "\u201cAh that is the secret,\u201d said Lebedeff, with a smile.",
            "\u201cWhose secret?\u201d",
            "\u201cYours. You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most excellent prince,\u201d murmured Lebedeff. Then, satisfied that he had worked up Muishkin\u2019s curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly: \u201cShe is afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna.\u201d",
            "The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:",
            "\u201cReally, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them away, too?\u201d",
            "\u201cThey are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very minute,\u201d said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and waving his hands as he ran from door to door.",
            "At that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that Lizabetha Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him.",
            "Moved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince.",
            "\u201cShall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Shall I let the general in?\u201d he asked.",
            "\u201cWhy not? Let in anyone who wants to see me. I assure you, Lebedeff, you have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been wrong all along. I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from anyone,\u201d replied the prince gaily.",
            "Seeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much agitated his satisfaction was quite visible.",
            "Colia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him. As they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeff\u2019s side of the house\u2014the Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch.",
            "The Epanchins had only just heard of the prince\u2019s illness and of his presence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a state of considerable bewilderment about him. The general brought the prince\u2019s card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that he himself would follow his card at once; she was much excited.",
            "In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see them. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing, and announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next day at latest.",
            "So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner, tea, and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs. Epanchin quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of pretexts without so much as mentioning the prince\u2019s name.",
            "On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked at dinner: \u201cMamma is cross because the prince hasn\u2019t turned up,\u201d to which the general replied that it was not his fault.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place she left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia came with the story of the prince\u2019s adventures, so far as he knew them. Mrs. Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long lecture. \u201cHe idles about here the whole day long, one can\u2019t get rid of him; and then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a line if he did not wish to inconvenience himself.\u201d",
            "At the words \u201cone can\u2019t get rid of him,\u201d Colia was very angry, and nearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and show his resentment later. If the words had been less offensive he might have forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha Prokofievna worried and anxious about the prince\u2019s illness.",
            "She would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain great medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and visit the invalid. Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little unceremonious to go _en masse_ to see him.",
            "\u201cVery well then, stay at home,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, \u201cand a good thing too, for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at home to receive him.\u201d",
            "Of course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest. In fact, she had never had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.",
            "Prince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies. He had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the Epanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had spent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago. Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the opportunity of meeting him again.",
            "The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie Pavlovitch arrived.",
            "It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchins\u2019 house to Lebedeff\u2019s. The first disagreeable impression experienced by Mrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of other guests\u2014not to mention the fact that some of those present were particularly detestable in her eyes. The next annoying circumstance was when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed, and smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.",
            "She was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia immensely. Of course he could have undeceived her before she started, but the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the probably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her dear friend, the prince, in good health. Colia was indelicate enough to voice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha Prokofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he was constantly sparring.",
            "\u201cJust wait a while, my boy!\u201d said she; \u201cdon\u2019t be too certain of your triumph.\u201d And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by the prince.",
            "Lebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the young ladies. Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged confidences in ecstatic whispers.",
            "\u201cI must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about like this\u2014I expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was only annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly. I am always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same. I assure you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own son,\u2014yes, and more; and if you don\u2019t believe me the more shame to you, and it\u2019s not my fault. But that spiteful boy delights in playing all sorts of tricks. You are his patron, it seems. Well, I warn you that one fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further acquaintance.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat have I done wrong now?\u201d cried Colia. \u201cWhat was the good of telling you that the prince was nearly well again? You would not have believed me; it was so much more interesting to picture him on his death-bed.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow long do you remain here, prince?\u201d asked Madame Epanchin.",
            "\u201cAll the summer, and perhaps longer.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are alone, aren\u2019t you,\u2014not married?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not married!\u201d replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness of this little feeler.",
            "\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t laugh! These things do happen, you know! Now then\u2014why didn\u2019t you come to us? We have a wing quite empty. But just as you like, of course. Do you lease it from _him?_\u2014this fellow, I mean,\u201d she added, nodding towards Lebedeff. \u201cAnd why does he always wriggle so?\u201d",
            "At that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out of the house, on to the terrace. Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the chairs, and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had no intention of going away. He no sooner caught sight of his daughter, than he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he even forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot.",
            "\u201cIs he mad?\u201d asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.",
            "\u201cNo, he...\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps he is drunk? Your company is rather peculiar,\u201d she added, with a glance at the other guests....",
            "\u201cBut what a pretty girl! Who is she?\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is Lebedeff\u2019s daughter\u2014Vera Lukianovna.\u201d",
            "\u201cIndeed? She looks very sweet. I should like to make her acquaintance.\u201d",
            "The words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera forward, in order to present her.",
            "\u201cOrphans, poor orphans!\u201d he began in a pathetic voice.",
            "\u201cThe child she carries is an orphan, too. She is Vera\u2019s sister, my daughter Luboff. The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife died, by the will of God Almighty.... Yes... Vera takes her mother\u2019s place, though she is but her sister... nothing more... nothing more...\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you! You are nothing more than a fool, if you\u2019ll excuse me! Well! well! you know that yourself, I expect,\u201d said the lady indignantly.",
            "Lebedeff bowed low. \u201cIt is the truth,\u201d he replied, with extreme respect.",
            "\u201cOh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse. Is it true?\u201d asked Aglaya.",
            "\u201cYes, that is so... for the last fifteen years.\u201d",
            "\u201cI have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, that was another commentator, whom the papers named. He is dead, however, and I have taken his place,\u201d said the other, much delighted.",
            "\u201cWe are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and explain the Apocalypse to me?\u201d said Aglaya. \u201cI do not understand it in the least.\u201d",
            "\u201cAllow me to warn you,\u201d interposed General Ivolgin, \u201cthat he is the greatest charlatan on earth.\u201d He had taken the chair next to the girl, and was impatient to begin talking. \u201cNo doubt there are pleasures and amusements peculiar to the country,\u201d he continued, \u201cand to listen to a pretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be as good as any other. It may even be original. But... you seem to be looking at me with some surprise\u2014may I introduce myself\u2014General Ivolgin\u2014I carried you in my arms as a baby\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDelighted, I\u2019m sure,\u201d said Aglaya; \u201cI am acquainted with Varvara Ardalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna.\u201d She was trying hard to restrain herself from laughing.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly needed an outlet. She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had once known, long ago\u2014in society.",
            "\u201cYou are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!\u201d she remarked, boiling over with indignation; \u201cyou never carried her in your life!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou have forgotten, mother,\u201d said Aglaya, suddenly. \u201cHe really did carry me about,\u2014in Tver, you know. I was six years old, I remember. He made me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon. Don\u2019t you remember shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden sword\u2014I remember!\u201d said Adelaida.",
            "\u201cYes, I remember too!\u201d said Alexandra. \u201cYou quarrelled about the wounded pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there with her helmet and sword and all.\u201d",
            "The poor general had merely made the remark about having carried Aglaya in his arms because he always did so begin a conversation with young people. But it happened that this time he had really hit upon the truth, though he had himself entirely forgotten the fact. But when Adelaida and Aglaya recalled the episode of the pigeon, his mind became filled with memories, and it is impossible to describe how this poor old man, usually half drunk, was moved by the recollection.",
            "\u201cI remember\u2014I remember it all!\u201d he cried. \u201cI was captain then. You were such a lovely little thing\u2014Nina Alexandrovna!\u2014Gania, listen! I was received then by General Epanchin.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, and look what you have come to now!\u201d interrupted Mrs. Epanchin. \u201cHowever, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away. But you\u2019ve broken your wife\u2019s heart, sir\u2014and instead of looking after your children, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtors\u2019 prisons! Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan your fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet! Go, go! I\u2019m serious! There\u2019s nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of the past with feelings of remorse!\u201d",
            "There was no need to repeat that she was serious. The general, like all drunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections of his better days. He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly that Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him.",
            "\u201cArdalion Alexandrovitch,\u201d she cried after him, \u201cwait a moment, we are all sinners! When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little less, come over to me and we\u2019ll have a talk about the past! I dare say I am fifty times more of a sinner than you are! And now go, go, good-bye, you had better not stay here!\u201d she added, in alarm, as he turned as though to come back.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t go after him just now, Colia, or he\u2019ll be vexed, and the benefit of this moment will be lost!\u201d said the prince, as the boy was hurrying out of the room.",
            "\u201cQuite true! Much better to go in half an hour or so,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s what comes of telling the truth for once in one\u2019s life!\u201d said Lebedeff. \u201cIt reduced him to tears.\u201d",
            "\u201cCome, come! the less _you_ say about it the better\u2014to judge from all I have heard about you!\u201d replied Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "The prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies that he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not themselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that she hoped he would still do so.",
            "By this time some of the visitors had disappeared.",
            "Ptitsin had tactfully retreated to Lebedeff\u2019s wing; and Gania soon followed him.",
            "The latter had behaved modestly, but with dignity, on this occasion of his first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture. Twice Mrs. Epanchin had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had stood fire without flinching. He was certainly much changed, as anyone could see who had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to afford Aglaya a good deal of satisfaction.",
            "\u201cThat was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked suddenly, interrupting somebody else\u2019s conversation to make the remark.",
            "\u201cYes, it was,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cI hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!\u201d",
            "\u201cI am very glad,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cHe has been very ill,\u201d added Varia.",
            "\u201cHow has he changed for the better?\u201d asked Mrs. Epanchin. \u201cI don\u2019t see any change for the better! What\u2019s better in him? Where did you get _that_ idea from? _what_\u2019s better?\u201d",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than the \u2018poor knight\u2019!\u201d said Colia, who was standing near the last speaker\u2019s chair.",
            "\u201cI quite agree with you there!\u201d said Prince S., laughing.",
            "\u201cSo do I,\u201d said Adelaida, solemnly.",
            "\u201c_What_ poor knight?\u201d asked Mrs. Epanchin, looking round at the face of each of the speakers in turn. Seeing, however, that Aglaya was blushing, she added, angrily:",
            "\u201cWhat nonsense you are all talking! What do you mean by poor knight?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his impudence by twisting other people\u2019s words,\u201d said Aglaya, haughtily.",
            "Every time that Aglaya showed temper (and this was very often), there was so much childish pouting, such \u201cschool-girlishness,\u201d as it were, in her apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to her own unutterable indignation. On these occasions she would say, \u201cHow can they, how _dare_ they laugh at me?\u201d",
            "This time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, Prince S., Prince Muishkin (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and Colia. Aglaya was dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her wrath.",
            "\u201cHe\u2019s always twisting round what one says,\u201d she cried.",
            "\u201cI am only repeating your own exclamation!\u201d said Colia. \u201cA month ago you were turning over the pages of your Don Quixote, and suddenly called out \u2018there is nothing better than the poor knight.\u2019 I don\u2019t know whom you were referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or someone else, but you certainly said these words, and afterwards there was a long conversation...\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your guesses,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, with some show of annoyance.",
            "\u201cBut it\u2019s not I alone,\u201d cried Colia. \u201cThey all talked about it, and they do still. Why, just now Prince S. and Adelaida Ivanovna declared that they upheld \u2018the poor knight\u2019; so evidently there does exist a \u2018poor knight\u2019; and if it were not for Adelaida Ivanovna, we should have known long ago who the \u2018poor knight\u2019 was.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, how am I to blame?\u201d asked Adelaida, smiling.",
            "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t draw his portrait for us, that\u2019s why you are to blame! Aglaya Ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole subject of the picture. She invented it herself; and you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat was I to draw? According to the lines she quoted:",
            "\u201c\u2018From his face he never lifted That eternal mask of steel.\u2019\u201d",
            " \u201cWhat sort of a face was I to draw? I couldn\u2019t draw a mask.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, irritably. She began to see pretty clearly though what it meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of \u201cpoor knight.\u201d But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was looking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.",
            "\u201cWell, have you finished your silly joke?\u201d she added, \u201cand am I to be told what this \u2018poor knight\u2019 means, or is it a solemn secret which cannot be approached lightly?\u201d",
            "But they all laughed on.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s simply that there is a Russian poem,\u201d began Prince S., evidently anxious to change the conversation, \u201ca strange thing, without beginning or end, and all about a \u2018poor knight.\u2019 A month or so ago, we were all talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaida\u2019s pictures\u2014you know it is the principal business of this family to find subjects for Adelaida\u2019s pictures. Well, we happened upon this \u2018poor knight.\u2019 I don\u2019t remember who thought of it first\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! Aglaya Ivanovna did,\u201d said Colia.",
            "\u201cVery likely\u2014I don\u2019t recollect,\u201d continued Prince S.",
            "\u201cSome of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see his face. We then began to think over all our friends\u2019 faces to see if any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood; that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the joke now. What was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all interest by this time.\u201d",
            "\u201cProbably there\u2019s some new silliness about it,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin, sarcastically.",
            "\u201cThere is no silliness about it at all\u2014only the profoundest respect,\u201d said Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper; in fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was delighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might have remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact of the prince\u2019s confusion became apparent to all.",
            "\u201c\u2018Profoundest respect!\u2019 What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and then, all of a sudden, a display of \u2018profoundest respect.\u2019 Why respect? Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this \u2018profound respect,\u2019 eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cBecause,\u201d replied Aglaya gravely, \u201cin the poem the knight is described as a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A device\u2014A. N. B.\u2014the meaning of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, A. N. D.,\u201d corrected Colia.",
            "\u201cI say A. N. B., and so it shall be!\u201d cried Aglaya, irritably. \u201cAnyway, the \u2018poor knight\u2019 did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she might say or do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in this one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course it\u2019s all an ideal, and in the \u2018poor knight\u2019 that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and respect his actions.\u201d",
            "So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest.",
            "\u201cPooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin; \u201cand as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!\u201d",
            "They certainly were put out, both of them.",
            "The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased.",
            "She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince\u2019s chair. All looked on with some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already, they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her recitation of the poem.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the street. The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.",
            "Their entrance caused some slight commotion. "
        ],
        "VII.": [
            "Aglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with her recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner, and at him alone. It was clear to him that she was doing all this with some special object.",
            "But the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and uncomfortable position. Seeing them approaching, he rose from his chair, and nodding amicably to the general, signed to him not to interrupt the recitation. He then got behind his chair, and stood there with his left hand resting on the back of it. Thanks to this change of position, he was able to listen to the ballad with far less embarrassment than before. Mrs. Epanchin had also twice motioned to the new arrivals to be quiet, and stay where they were.",
            "The prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered. He easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom he had already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by the young man\u2019s plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenie\u2019s lips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was probably in the secret of the \u2018poor knight\u2019 joke. But it had become quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of manner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a manner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret.",
            "Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite:",
            "\u201cOnce there came a vision glorious, Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair; Burned itself into his spirit, And abode for ever there!",
            "\u201cNever more\u2014from that sweet moment\u2014 Gaz\u00e9d he on womankind; He was dumb to love and wooing And to all their graces blind.",
            "\u201cFull of love for that sweet vision, Brave and pure he took the field; With his blood he stained the letters N. P. B. upon his shield.",
            "\u201c\u2018Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!\u2019 Shouting on the foe he fell, And like thunder rang his war-cry O\u2019er the cowering infidel.",
            "\u201cThen within his distant castle, Home returned, he dreamed his days\u2014 Silent, sad,\u2014and when death took him He was mad, the legend says.\u201d",
            " When recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of him understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of the girl with the irony of this jest. That it was a jest there was no doubt whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too, for his conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had deliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B. He was quite sure she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not deceived him. At all events her performance\u2014which was a joke, of course, if rather a crude one,\u2014was premeditated. They had evidently talked (and laughed) over the \u2018poor knight\u2019 for more than a month.",
            "Yet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the slightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but with so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly anyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones written in the ballad. The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon the prince. Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of initials or in the insinuation embodied therein. General Epanchin only knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had understood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point.",
            "\u201cHow beautiful that is!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration. \u201cWhose is it?\u201d",
            "\u201cPushkin\u2019s, mama, of course! Don\u2019t disgrace us all by showing your ignorance,\u201d said Adelaida.",
            "\u201cAs soon as we reach home give it to me to read.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house.\u201d",
            "\u201cThere are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about from time immemorial,\u201d added Alexandra.",
            "\u201cSend Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.\u2014Aglaya, come here\u2014kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but,\u201d she added in a whisper, \u201cif you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at all. Do you understand?\u2014Now come along, young woman; we\u2019ve sat here too long. I\u2019ll speak to you about this another time.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin, and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.",
            "\u201cI caught him up on the way to your house,\u201d explained the general. \u201cHe had heard that we were all here.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, and I heard that you were here, too,\u201d added Evgenie Pavlovitch; \u201cand since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only your acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time, but came straight on. I am sorry to hear that you are unwell.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I\u2019m quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your acquaintance. Prince S. has often spoken to me about you,\u201d said Muishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one another\u2019s eyes.",
            "The prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s plain clothes had evidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so that all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising fact.",
            "His change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. Adelaida and Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative of the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited. Aglaya alone was not interested. She merely looked closely at Evgenie for a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes became him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or his costume. Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear that she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her good graces.",
            "\u201cHe has astonished me,\u201d said Ivan Fedorovitch. \u201cI nearly fell down with surprise. I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg just now. Why this haste? That\u2019s what I want to know. He has always said himself that there is no need to break windows.\u201d",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of leaving the service long ago. He had, however, always made more or less of a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously. For that matter he joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe, especially if he did not wish them to understand him.",
            "\u201cI have only retired for a time,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cFor a few months; at most for a year.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut there is no necessity for you to retire at all,\u201d complained the general, \u201cas far as I know.\u201d",
            "\u201cI want to go and look after my country estates. You advised me to do that yourself,\u201d was the reply. \u201cAnd then I wish to go abroad.\u201d",
            "After a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other channels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought all this excitement about so small a matter very curious. \u201cThere must be more in it than appears,\u201d he said to himself.",
            "\u201cI see the \u2018poor knight\u2019 has come on the scene again,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, stepping to Aglaya\u2019s side.",
            "To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give him to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them about the \u2018poor knight,\u2019 and that she did not understand his question.",
            "\u201cBut not now! It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now. It is much too late, I say!\u201d Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice. \u201cI have told you so at least a hundred times.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, it is really much too late to send to town now,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible. \u201cI am sure the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight o\u2019clock,\u201d he added, looking at his watch.",
            "\u201cWe have done without him so far,\u201d interrupted Adelaida in her turn. \u201cSurely we can wait until to-morrow.\u201d",
            "\u201cBesides,\u201d said Colia, \u201cit is quite unusual, almost improper, for people in our position to take any interest in literature. Ask Evgenie Pavlovitch if I am not right. It is much more fashionable to drive a waggonette with red wheels.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou got that from some magazine, Colia,\u201d remarked Adelaida.",
            "\u201cHe gets most of his conversation in that way,\u201d laughed Evgenie Pavlovitch. \u201cHe borrows whole phrases from the reviews. I have long had the pleasure of knowing both Nicholai Ardalionovitch and his conversational methods, but this time he was not repeating something he had read; he was alluding, no doubt, to my yellow waggonette, which has, or had, red wheels. But I have exchanged it, so you are rather behind the times, Colia.\u201d",
            "The prince had been listening attentively to Radomski\u2019s words, and thought his manner very pleasant. When Colia chaffed him about his waggonette he had replied with perfect equality and in a friendly fashion. This pleased Muishkin.",
            "At this moment Vera came up to Lizabetha Prokofievna, carrying several large and beautifully bound books, apparently quite new.",
            "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d demanded the lady.",
            "\u201cThis is Pushkin,\u201d replied the girl. \u201cPapa told me to offer it to you.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat? Impossible!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Epanchin.",
            "\u201cNot as a present, not as a present! I should not have taken the liberty,\u201d said Lebedeff, appearing suddenly from behind his daughter. \u201cIt is our own Pushkin, our family copy, Annenkoff\u2019s edition; it could not be bought now. I beg to suggest, with great respect, that your excellency should buy it, and thus quench the noble literary thirst which is consuming you at this moment,\u201d he concluded grandiloquently.",
            "\u201cOh! if you will sell it, very good\u2014and thank you. You shall not be a loser! But for goodness\u2019 sake, don\u2019t twist about like that, sir! I have heard of you; they tell me you are a very learned person. We must have a talk one of these days. You will bring me the books yourself?\u201d",
            "\u201cWith the greatest respect... and... and veneration,\u201d replied Lebedeff, making extraordinary grimaces.",
            "\u201cWell, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not drop them on the way; but on the condition,\u201d went on the lady, looking full at him, \u201cthat you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to receive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like. I am much pleased with her.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell him about them?\u201d said Vera impatiently to her father. \u201cThey will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d\u2014she addressed herself to the prince\u2014\u201cfour men are here asking for you. They have waited some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them in.\u201d",
            "\u201cWho are these people?\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cThey say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them. Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to make them hear reason.\u201d",
            "\u201cPavlicheff\u2019s son! It is not worth while!\u201d cried Lebedeff. \u201cThere is no necessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your excellency. They do not deserve...\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat? Pavlicheff\u2019s son!\u201d cried the prince, much perturbed. \u201cI know... I know\u2014but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch. He told me...\u201d",
            "At that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace. From an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General Ivolgin, in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down. Colia rushed off at once to investigate the cause of the uproar.",
            "\u201cThis is most interesting!\u201d observed Evgenie Pavlovitch.",
            "\u201cI expect he knows all about it!\u201d thought the prince.",
            "\u201cWhat, the son of Pavlicheff? And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?\u201d asked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him, he discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery. Expectation and suspense were on every face, with the exception of that of the prince, who stood gravely wondering how an affair so entirely personal could have awakened such lively and widespread interest in so short a time.",
            "Aglaya went up to him with a peculiarly serious look.",
            "\u201cIt will be well,\u201d she said, \u201cif you put an end to this affair yourself _at once_: but you must allow us to be your witnesses. They want to throw mud at you, prince, and you must be triumphantly vindicated. I give you joy beforehand!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd I also wish for justice to be done, once for all,\u201d cried Madame Epanchin, \u201cabout this impudent claim. Deal with them promptly, prince, and don\u2019t spare them! I am sick of hearing about the affair, and many a quarrel I have had in your cause. But I confess I am anxious to see what happens, so do make them come out here, and we will remain. You have heard people talking about it, no doubt?\u201d she added, turning to Prince S.",
            "\u201cOf course,\u201d said he. \u201cI have heard it spoken about at your house, and I am anxious to see these young men!\u201d",
            "\u201cThey are Nihilists, are they not?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, they are not Nihilists,\u201d explained Lebedeff, who seemed much excited. \u201cThis is another lot\u2014a special group. According to my nephew they are more advanced even than the Nihilists. You are quite wrong, excellency, if you think that your presence will intimidate them; nothing intimidates them. Educated men, learned men even, are to be found among Nihilists; these go further, in that they are men of action. The movement is, properly speaking, a derivative from Nihilism\u2014though they are only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for they never advertise their doings in the papers. They go straight to the point. For them, it is not a question of showing that Pushkin is stupid, or that Russia must be torn in pieces. No; but if they have a great desire for anything, they believe they have a right to get it even at the cost of the lives, say, of eight persons. They are checked by no obstacles. In fact, prince, I should not advise you...\u201d",
            "But Muishkin had risen, and was on his way to open the door for his visitors.",
            "\u201cYou are slandering them, Lebedeff,\u201d said he, smiling.",
            "\u201cYou are always thinking about your nephew\u2019s conduct. Don\u2019t believe him, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I can assure you Gorsky and Daniloff are exceptions\u2014and that these are only... mistaken. However, I do not care about receiving them here, in public. Excuse me, Lizabetha Prokofievna. They are coming, and you can see them, and then I will take them away. Please come in, gentlemen!\u201d",
            "Another thought tormented him: He wondered was this an arranged business\u2014arranged to happen when he had guests in his house, and in anticipation of his humiliation rather than of his triumph? But he reproached himself bitterly for such a thought, and felt as if he should die of shame if it were discovered. When his new visitors appeared, he was quite ready to believe himself infinitely less to be respected than any of them.",
            "Four persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great excitement, and talking eloquently.",
            "\u201cHe is for me, undoubtedly!\u201d thought the prince, with a smile. Colia also had joined the party, and was talking with animation to Hippolyte, who listened with a jeering smile on his lips.",
            "The prince begged the visitors to sit down. They were all so young that it made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. Ivan Fedorovitch, who really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at the sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it not been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair. He therefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through good-nature, hoping that his presence might be of some use. But the bow with which General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned, and decided to be absolutely silent.",
            "As to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a boxer, who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given fifteen roubles at a time to beggars. Evidently he had joined the others as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material, support. The man who had been spoken of as \u201cPavlicheff\u2019s son,\u201d although he gave the name of Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age, fair, thin and rather tall. He was remarkable for the poverty, not to say uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his overcoat were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck, showed not a trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it resembled a cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed. He looked round with an air of insolent effrontery. His face, covered with pimples, was neither thoughtful nor even contemptuous; it wore an expression of complacent satisfaction in demanding his rights and in being an aggrieved party. His voice trembled, and he spoke so fast, and with such stammerings, that he might have been taken for a foreigner, though the purest Russian blood ran in his veins. Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, whom the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and also the youth named Hippolyte Terentieff. The latter was only seventeen or eighteen. He had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated and fretful in expression. His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly complexion, the brightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his cheeks, betrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance. He coughed persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had but a few weeks more to live. He was nearly dead with fatigue, and fell, rather than sat, into a chair. The rest bowed as they came in; and being more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme self-assurance. In short, their attitude was not that which one would have expected in men who professed to despise all trivialities, all foolish mundane conventions, and indeed everything, except their own personal interests.",

            "\u201cProletarians and scions of nobility! An episode of the brigandage of today and every day! Progress! Reform! Justice!\u201d",
            "\u201cStrange things are going on in our so-called Holy Russia in this age of reform and great enterprises; this age of patriotism in which hundreds of millions are yearly sent abroad; in which industry is encouraged, and the hands of Labour paralyzed, etc.; there is no end to this, gentlemen, so let us come to the point. A strange thing has happened to a scion of our defunct aristocracy. (_De profundis!_) The grandfathers of these scions ruined themselves at the gaming-tables; their fathers were forced to serve as officers or subalterns; some have died just as they were about to be tried for innocent thoughtlessness in the handling of public funds. Their children are sometimes congenital idiots, like the hero of our story; sometimes they are found in the dock at the Assizes, where they are generally acquitted by the jury for edifying motives; sometimes they distinguish themselves by one of those burning scandals that amaze the public and add another blot to the stained record of our age. Six months ago\u2014that is, last winter\u2014this particular scion returned to Russia, wearing gaiters like a foreigner, and shivering with cold in an old scantily-lined cloak. He had come from Switzerland, where he had just undergone a successful course of treatment for idiocy (_sic!_). Certainly Fortune favoured him, for, apart from the interesting malady of which he was cured in Switzerland (can there be a cure for idiocy?) his story proves the truth of the Russian proverb that \u2018happiness is the right of certain classes!\u2019 Judge for yourselves. Our subject was an infant in arms when he lost his father, an officer who died just as he was about to be court-martialled for gambling away the funds of his company, and perhaps also for flogging a subordinate to excess (remember the good old days, gentlemen). The orphan was brought up by the charity of a very rich Russian landowner. In the good old days, this man, whom we will call P\u2014\u2014, owned four thousand souls as serfs (souls as serfs!\u2014can you understand such an expression, gentlemen? I cannot; it must be looked up in a dictionary before one can understand it; these things of a bygone day are already unintelligible to us). He appears to have been one of those Russian parasites who lead an idle existence abroad, spending the summer at some spa, and the winter in Paris, to the greater profit of the organizers of public balls. It may safely be said that the manager of the Chateau des Fleurs (lucky man!) pocketed at least a third of the money paid by Russian peasants to their lords in the days of serfdom. However this may be, the gay P\u2014\u2014 brought up the orphan like a prince, provided him with tutors and governesses (pretty, of course!) whom he chose himself in Paris. But the little aristocrat, the last of his noble race, was an idiot. The governesses, recruited at the Chateau des Fleurs, laboured in vain; at twenty years of age their pupil could not speak in any language, not even Russian. But ignorance of the latter was still excusable. At last P\u2014\u2014 was seized with a strange notion; he imagined that in Switzerland they could change an idiot into a man of sense. After all, the idea was quite logical; a parasite and landowner naturally supposed that intelligence was a marketable commodity like everything else, and that in Switzerland especially it could be bought for money. The case was entrusted to a celebrated Swiss professor, and cost thousands of roubles; the treatment lasted five years. Needless to say, the idiot did not become intelligent, but it is alleged that he grew into something more or less resembling a man. At this stage P\u2014\u2014 died suddenly, and, as usual, he had made no will and left his affairs in disorder. A crowd of eager claimants arose, who cared nothing about any last scion of a noble race undergoing treatment in Switzerland, at the expense of the deceased, as a congenital idiot. Idiot though he was, the noble scion tried to cheat his professor, and they say he succeeded in getting him to continue the treatment gratis for two years, by concealing the death of his benefactor. But the professor himself was a charlatan. Getting anxious at last when no money was forthcoming, and alarmed above all by his patient\u2019s appetite, he presented him with a pair of old gaiters and a shabby cloak and packed him off to Russia, third class. It would seem that Fortune had turned her back upon our hero. Not at all; Fortune, who lets whole populations die of hunger, showered all her gifts at once upon the little aristocrat, like Kryloff\u2019s Cloud which passes over an arid plain and empties itself into the sea. He had scarcely arrived in St. Petersburg, when a relation of his mother\u2019s (who was of bourgeois origin, of course), died at Moscow. He was a merchant, an Old Believer, and he had no children. He left a fortune of several millions in good current coin, and everything came to our noble scion, our gaitered baron, formerly treated for idiocy in a Swiss lunatic asylum. Instantly the scene changed, crowds of friends gathered round our baron, who meanwhile had lost his head over a celebrated demi-mondaine; he even discovered some relations; moreover a number of young girls of high birth burned to be united to him in lawful matrimony. Could anyone possibly imagine a better match? Aristocrat, millionaire, and idiot, he has every advantage! One might hunt in vain for his equal, even with the lantern of Diogenes; his like is not to be had even by getting it made to order!\u201d",

            "Colia had no choice but to obey. With crimson cheeks he read on unsteadily:",
            "\u201cBut while our young millionaire dwelt as it were in the Empyrean, something new occurred. One fine morning a man called upon him, calm and severe of aspect, distinguished, but plainly dressed. Politely, but in dignified terms, as befitted his errand, he briefly explained the motive for his visit. He was a lawyer of enlightened views; his client was a young man who had consulted him in confidence. This young man was no other than the son of P\u2014\u2014, though he bears another name. In his youth P\u2014\u2014, the sensualist, had seduced a young girl, poor but respectable. She was a serf, but had received a European education. Finding that a child was expected, he hastened her marriage with a man of noble character who had loved her for a long time. He helped the young couple for a time, but he was soon obliged to give up, for the high-minded husband refused to accept anything from him. Soon the careless nobleman forgot all about his former mistress and the child she had borne him; then, as we know, he died intestate. P\u2014\u2014\u2019s son, born after his mother\u2019s marriage, found a true father in the generous man whose name he bore. But when he also died, the orphan was left to provide for himself, his mother now being an invalid who had lost the use of her limbs. Leaving her in a distant province, he came to the capital in search of pupils. By dint of daily toil he earned enough to enable him to follow the college courses, and at last to enter the university. But what can one earn by teaching the children of Russian merchants at ten copecks a lesson, especially with an invalid mother to keep? Even her death did not much diminish the hardships of the young man\u2019s struggle for existence. Now this is the question: how, in the name of justice, should our scion have argued the case? Our readers will think, no doubt, that he would say to himself: \u2018P\u2014\u2014 showered benefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands of roubles to educate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me under treatment in Switzerland. Now I am a millionaire, and P\u2014\u2014\u2019s son, a noble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his careless and forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid lessons. According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done for him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone to P\u2014\u2014\u2019s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom P\u2014\u2014 interested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a father. If I wished to behave nobly, justly, and with delicacy, I ought to bestow half my fortune upon the son of my benefactor; but as economy is my favourite virtue, and I know this is not a case in which the law can intervene, I will not give up half my millions. But it would be too openly vile, too flagrantly infamous, if I did not at least restore to P\u2014\u2014\u2019s son the tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy. This is simply a case of conscience and of strict justice. Whatever would have become of me if P\u2014\u2014 had not looked after my education, and had taken care of his own son instead of me?\u2019",
            "\u201cNo, gentlemen, our scions of the nobility do not reason thus. The lawyer, who had taken up the matter purely out of friendship to the young man, and almost against his will, invoked every consideration of justice, delicacy, honour, and even plain figures; in vain, the ex-patient of the Swiss lunatic asylum was inflexible. All this might pass, but the sequel is absolutely unpardonable, and not to be excused by any interesting malady. This millionaire, having but just discarded the old gaiters of his professor, could not even understand that the noble young man slaving away at his lessons was not asking for charitable help, but for his rightful due, though the debt was not a legal one; that, correctly speaking, he was not asking for anything, but it was merely his friends who had thought fit to bestir themselves on his behalf. With the cool insolence of a bloated capitalist, secure in his millions, he majestically drew a banknote for fifty roubles from his pocket-book and sent it to the noble young man as a humiliating piece of charity. You can hardly believe it, gentlemen! You are scandalized and disgusted; you cry out in indignation! But that is what he did! Needless to say, the money was returned, or rather flung back in his face. The case is not within the province of the law, it must be referred to the tribunal of public opinion; this is what we now do, guaranteeing the truth of all the details which we have related.\u201d",
            "When Colia had finished reading, he handed the paper to the prince, and retired silently to a corner of the room, hiding his face in his hands. He was overcome by a feeling of inexpressible shame; his boyish sensitiveness was wounded beyond endurance. It seemed to him that something extraordinary, some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that he was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.",
            "Yet all the others were similarly affected. The girls were uncomfortable and ashamed. Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained her violent anger by a great effort; perhaps she bitterly regretted her interference in the matter; for the present she kept silence. The prince felt as very shy people often do in such a case; he was so ashamed of the conduct of other people, so humiliated for his guests, that he dared not look them in the face. Ptitsin, Varia, Gania, and Lebedeff himself, all looked rather confused. Stranger still, Hippolyte and the \u201cson of Pavlicheff\u201d also seemed slightly surprised, and Lebedeff\u2019s nephew was obviously far from pleased. The boxer alone was perfectly calm; he twisted his moustaches with affected dignity, and if his eyes were cast down it was certainly not in confusion, but rather in noble modesty, as if he did not wish to be insolent in his triumph. It was evident that he was delighted with the article.",

He was indignant with Lizabetha Prokofievna, who did not think of moving even now.",
            "\u201cGentlemen, gentlemen, let me speak at last,\u201d cried the prince, anxious and agitated. \u201cPlease let us understand one another. I say nothing about the article, gentlemen, except that every word is false; I say this because you know it as well as I do. It is shameful. I should be surprised if any one of you could have written it.\u201d",

            "\u201cI was only surprised that Mr. Burdovsky should have\u2014however, this is what I have to say. Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?\u201d",
            "\u201cAt last!\u201d murmured Lizabetha Prokofievna indignantly.",
            "Lebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the row of chairs.",

You are also forgetting, most excellent prince, that you are with friends, a select company; you cannot sacrifice them to these gentlemen, and it is only for you to have them turned out this instant. As the master of the house I shall have great pleasure ....\u201d",

            "\u201cThat will do, Lebedeff, that will do\u2014\u201d began the prince, when an indignant outcry drowned his words.",
            "\u201cExcuse me, prince, excuse me, but now that will not do,\u201d shouted Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, his voice dominating all the others. \u201cThe matter must be clearly stated, for it is obviously not properly understood. They are calling in some legal chicanery, and upon that ground they are threatening to turn us out of the house! Really, prince, do you think we are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within the law, and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you? But we are also aware that if actual law is not on our side, human law is for us, natural law, the law of common-sense and conscience, which is no less binding upon every noble and honest man\u2014that is, every man of sane judgment\u2014because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes. If we come here without fear of being turned out (as was threatened just now) because of the imperative tone of our demand, and the unseemliness of such a visit at this late hour (though it was not late when we arrived, we were kept waiting in your anteroom), if, I say, we came in without fear, it is just because we expected to find you a man of sense; I mean, a man of honour and conscience. It is quite true that we did not present ourselves humbly, like your flatterers and parasites, but holding up our heads as befits independent men. We present no petition, but a proud and free demand (note it well, we do not beseech, we demand!). We ask you fairly and squarely in a dignified manner. Do you believe that in this affair of Burdovsky you have right on your side? Do you admit that Pavlicheff overwhelmed you with benefits, and perhaps saved your life? If you admit it (which we take for granted), do you intend, now that you are a millionaire, and do you not think it in conformity with justice, to indemnify Burdovsky? Yes or no? If it is yes, or, in other words, if you possess what you call honour and conscience, and we more justly call common-sense, then accede to our demand, and the matter is at an end. Give us satisfaction, without entreaties or thanks from us; do not expect thanks from us, for what you do will be done not for our sake, but for the sake of justice. If you refuse to satisfy us, that is, if your answer is no, we will go away at once, and there will be an end of the matter. But we will tell you to your face before the present company that you are a man of vulgar and undeveloped mind; we will openly deny you the right to speak in future of your honour and conscience, for you have not paid the fair price of such a right. I have no more to say\u2014I have put the question before you. Now turn us out if you dare. You can do it; force is on your side. But remember that we do not beseech, we demand! We do not beseech, we demand!\u201d",

I cannot undertake to say precisely what it is, but you have certainly omitted something, and you cannot be quite just while there is something lacking.

I know he is a cross between a fool and an adventurer; I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day. But after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of every man; consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted. Let him answer for his own blunders. As to the objection which I made just now in the name of all, to the presence of your friends, I think I ought to explain, gentlemen, that I only did so to assert our rights, though we really wished to have witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point before we came in. We do not care who your witnesses may be, or whether they are your friends or not. As they cannot fail to recognize Burdovsky\u2019s right (seeing that it is mathematically demonstrable), it is just as well that the witnesses should be your friends.

He immediately gave me permission to publish it, but you will admit that I might have done so without his consent. Publicity is a noble, beneficent, and universal right.

As to certain inaccuracies and figures of speech, so to speak, you will also admit that the motive, aim, and intention, are the chief thing. It is a question, above all, of making a wholesome example; the individual case can be examined afterwards; and as to the style\u2014well, the thing was meant to be humorous, so to speak, and, after all, everybody writes like that; you must admit it yourself!

            "\u201cBut, gentlemen, I assure you that you are quite astray,\u201d exclaimed the prince. \u201cYou have published this article upon the supposition that I would never consent to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky. Acting on that conviction, you have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to be revenged for my supposed refusal. But what did you know of my intentions? It may be that I have resolved to satisfy Mr. Burdovsky\u2019s claim. I now declare openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that I will do so.\u201d",

            "\u201cI will explain matters to you. Five weeks ago I received a visit from Tchebaroff, your agent, Mr. Burdovsky. You have given a very flattering description of him in your article, Mr. Keller,\u201d he continued, turning to the boxer with a smile, \u201cbut he did not please me at all. I saw at once that Tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak frankly, I thought he might have induced you, Mr. Burdovsky, to make this claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou have no right.... I am not simple,\u201d stammered Burdovsky, much agitated.",

            "\u201cIt is most offensive!\u201d shrieked Hippolyte; \u201cit is an insulting suggestion, false, and most ill-timed.\u201d",
            "\u201cI beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,\u201d said the prince. \u201cI thought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, but have it your own way. I told Tchebaroff that, as I was not in Petersburg, I would commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and that I would let you know, Mr. Burdovsky. Gentlemen, I have no hesitation in telling you that it was the fact of Tchebaroff\u2019s intervention that made me suspect a fraud. Oh! do not take offence at my words, gentlemen, for Heaven\u2019s sake do not be so touchy!\u201d cried the prince, seeing that Burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the rest were preparing to protest. \u201cIf I say I suspected a fraud, there is nothing personal in that. I had never seen any of you then; I did not even know your names; I only judged by Tchebaroff; I am speaking quite generally\u2014if you only knew how I have been \u2018done\u2019 since I came into my fortune!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are shockingly naive, prince,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew in mocking tones.",
            "\u201cBesides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though you may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside the general law,\u201d Hippolyte declared loudly.",
            "\u201cPerhaps not; it is very possible,\u201d the prince agreed hastily, \u201cthough I do not know what general law you allude to. I will go on\u2014only please do not take offence without good cause. I assure you I do not mean to offend you in the least. Really, it is impossible to speak three words sincerely without your flying into a rage! At first I was amazed when Tchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such a miserable position. Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my father\u2019s friend. Oh, Mr. Keller, why does your article impute things to my father without the slightest foundation? He never squandered the funds of his company nor ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely certain of it; I cannot imagine how you could bring yourself to write such a calumny! But your assertions concerning Pavlicheff are absolutely intolerable! You do not scruple to make a libertine of that noble man; you call him a sensualist as coolly as if you were speaking the truth, and yet it would not be possible to find a chaster man. He was even a scholar of note, and in correspondence with several celebrated scientists, and spent large sums in the interests of science. As to his kind heart and his good actions, you were right indeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time, and could hardly understand anything\u2014(I could speak and understand Russian, though),\u2014but now I can appreciate what I remember\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d interrupted Hippolyte, \u201cis not this rather sentimental? You said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after nine o\u2019clock.\u201d",
            "\u201cVery well, gentlemen\u2014very well,\u201d replied the prince. \u201cAt first I received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother\u2019s honour. For Tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview....\u201d",

            "\u201cThat seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,\u201d said the prince timidly.",
            "\u201cPrince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the limit,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, with a sarcastic smile.",
            "\u201cBut what right had you?\u201d said Hippolyte in a very strange tone.",
            "\u201cNone\u2014none whatever,\u201d agreed the prince hastily. \u201cI admit you are right there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my personal feelings had nothing to do with it,\u2014that if I thought it right to satisfy the demands of Mr. Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed Mr. Burdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother\u2019s secret in such a way. In short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a rogue, and that he had induced Mr. Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut this is intolerable!\u201d cried the visitors, some of them starting to their feet.",
            "\u201cGentlemen, I supposed from this that poor Mr. Burdovsky must be a simple-minded man, quite defenceless, and an easy tool in the hands of rogues. That is why I thought it my duty to try and help him as \u2018Pavlicheff\u2019s son\u2019; in the first place by rescuing him from the influence of Tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend. I have resolved to give him ten thousand roubles; that is about the sum which I calculate that Pavlicheff must have spent on me.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, only ten thousand!\u201d cried Hippolyte.",
            "\u201cWell, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are mighty clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew.",
            "\u201cI will not accept ten thousand roubles,\u201d said Burdovsky.",
            "\u201cAccept, Antip,\u201d whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of Hippolyte\u2019s chair to give his friend this piece of advice. \u201cTake it for the present; we can see about more later on.\u201d",
            "\u201cLook here, Mr. Muishkin,\u201d shouted Hippolyte, \u201cplease understand that we are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these ladies who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine gentleman\u201d (pointing to Evgenie Pavlovitch) \u201cwhom I have not the honour of knowing, though I think I have heard some talk about him\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cReally, really, gentlemen,\u201d cried the prince in great agitation, \u201cyou are misunderstanding me again. In the first place, Mr. Keller, you have greatly overestimated my fortune in your article. I am far from being a millionaire. I have barely a tenth of what you suppose. Secondly, my treatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of roubles. Schneider received six hundred roubles a year, and he was only paid for the first three years. As to the pretty governesses whom Pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist in Mr. Keller\u2019s imagination; it is another calumny. According to my calculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under ten thousand roubles, but I decided on that sum, and you must admit that in paying a debt I could not offer Mr. Burdovsky more, however kindly disposed I might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to be offering him charity instead of rightful payment. I don\u2019t know how you cannot see that, gentlemen! Besides, I had no intention of leaving the matter there. I meant to intervene amicably later on and help to improve poor Mr. Burdovsky\u2019s position. It is clear that he has been deceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the scandalous revelations about his mother in Mr. Keller\u2019s article. But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again? Are we never to come to an understanding? Well, the event has proved me right! I have just seen with my own eyes the proof that my conjecture was correct!\u201d he added, with increasing eagerness.",
            "He meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had only increased their irritation.",
            "\u201cWhat do you mean? What are you convinced of?\u201d they demanded angrily.",
            "\u201cIn the first place, I have had the opportunity of getting a correct idea of Mr. Burdovsky. I see what he is for myself. He is an innocent man, deceived by everyone! A defenceless victim, who deserves indulgence! Secondly, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, in whose hands I had placed the matter, had his first interview with me barely an hour ago. I had not heard from him for some time, as I was away, and have been ill for three days since my return to St. Petersburg. He tells me that he has exposed the designs of Tchebaroff and has proof that justifies my opinion of him. I know, gentlemen, that many people think me an idiot. Counting upon my reputation as a man whose purse-strings are easily loosened, Tchebaroff thought it would be a simple matter to fleece me, especially by trading on my gratitude to Pavlicheff. But the main point is\u2014listen, gentlemen, let me finish!\u2014the main point is that Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff\u2019s son at all. Gavrila Ardalionovitch has just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive proofs. Well, what do you think of that? It is scarcely credible, even after all the tricks that have been played upon me. Please note that we have positive proofs! I can hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I do not yet believe it; I am still doubtful, because Gavrila Ardalionovitch has not had time to go into details; but there can be no further doubt that Tchebaroff is a rogue! He has deceived poor Mr. Burdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your friend\u2014(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!). He has abused your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all is said and done this claim is nothing else!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheff\u2019s son? Impossible!\u201d",
            "These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into which the prince\u2019s words had plunged Burdovsky\u2019s companions.",
            "\u201cCertainly it is a fraud! Since Mr. Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff\u2019s son, his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been deceived. I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter. But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just the same myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all the better able to pity Mr. Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to be like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well, though there is no such person as \u2018Pavlicheff\u2019s son,\u2019 and it is all nothing but a humbug, yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up ten thousand roubles in memory of Pavlicheff. Before Mr. Burdovsky made this claim, I proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the ten thousand roubles to Mr. Burdovsky, because, though he was not Pavlicheff\u2019s son, he was treated almost as though he were. That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he really did think himself Pavlicheff\u2019s son. Listen, gentlemen; this matter must be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down! Gavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I confess that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself. He says that he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, Mr. Burdovsky; she is not dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. Sit down, gentlemen, sit down!\u201d",
            "The prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovsky\u2019s company to do likewise. During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with great vehemence. Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. If he had not been driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to express certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than his heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was suffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated in Switzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in having offered him the ten thousand roubles before everyone. \u201cI ought to have waited till to-morrow and offered him the money when we were alone,\u201d thought Muishkin. \u201cNow it is too late, the mischief is done! Yes, I am an idiot, an absolute idiot!\u201d he said to himself, overcome with shame and regret.",
            "Till then Gavrila Ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. When the prince called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm, clear voice began to render an account of the mission confided to him. All conversation ceased instantly. Everyone, especially the Burdovsky party, listened with the utmost curiosity. "

            "\u201cAs a matter of fact, I did not read it,\u201d interrupted the boxer, \u201cbut its contents had been given me on unimpeachable authority, and I...\u201d",
            "\u201cExcuse me, Mr. Keller,\u201d interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch. \u201cAllow me to speak. I assure you your article shall be mentioned in its proper place, and you can then explain everything, but for the moment I would rather not anticipate. Quite accidentally, with the help of my sister, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, I obtained from one of her intimate friends, Madame Zoubkoff, a letter written to her twenty-five years ago, by Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, then abroad. After getting into communication with this lady, I went by her advice to Timofei Fedorovitch Viazovkin, a retired colonel, and one of Pavlicheff\u2019s oldest friends. He gave me two more letters written by the latter when he was still in foreign parts. These three documents, their dates, and the facts mentioned in them, prove in the most undeniable manner, that eighteen months before your birth, Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad, where he remained for three consecutive years. Your mother, as you are well aware, has never been out of Russia.... It is too late to read the letters now; I am content to state the fact. But if you desire it, come to me tomorrow morning, bring witnesses and writing experts with you, and I will prove the absolute truth of my story. From that moment the question will be decided.\u201d",
            "These words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a general movement of relief. Burdovsky got up abruptly.",
            "\u201cIf that is true,\u201d said he, \u201cI have been deceived, grossly deceived, but not by Tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time. I do not wish for experts, not I, nor to go to see you. I believe you. I give it up.... But I refuse the ten thousand roubles. Good-bye.\u201d",
            "\u201cWait five minutes more, Mr. Burdovsky,\u201d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch pleasantly. \u201cI have more to say. Some rather curious and important facts have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, that you should hear them. You will not regret, I fancy, to have the whole matter thoroughly cleared up.\u201d",
            "Burdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in profound thought. His friend, Lebedeff\u2019s nephew, who had risen to accompany him, also sat down again. He seemed much disappointed, though as self-confident as ever. Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well as surprised. He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing, so that his handkerchief was stained with blood. The boxer looked thoroughly frightened.",
            "\u201cOh, Antip!\u201d cried he in a miserable voice, \u201cI did say to you the other day\u2014the day before yesterday\u2014that perhaps you were not really Pavlicheff\u2019s son!\u201d",
            "There were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this.",
            "\u201cNow, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller,\u201d replied Gania. \u201cHowever that may be, I have private information which convinces me that Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth, knew nothing at all about Pavlicheff\u2019s sojourn abroad. Indeed, he passed the greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at intervals for short visits. The journey in question is in itself too unimportant for his friends to recollect it after more than twenty years; and of course Mr. Burdovsky could have known nothing about it, for he was not born. As the event has proved, it was not impossible to find evidence of his absence, though I must confess that chance has helped me in a quest which might very well have come to nothing. It was really almost impossible for Burdovsky or Tchebaroff to discover these facts, even if it had entered their heads to try. Naturally they never dreamt...\u201d",
            "Here the voice of Hippolyte suddenly intervened.",
            "\u201cAllow me, Mr. Ivolgin,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cWhat is the good of all this rigmarole? Pardon me. All is now clear, and we acknowledge the truth of your main point. Why go into these tedious details? You wish perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as detective? Or perhaps your intention is to excuse Burdovsky, by proving that he took up the matter in ignorance? Well, I consider that extremely impudent on your part! You ought to know that Burdovsky has no need of being excused or justified by you or anyone else! It is an insult! The affair is quite painful enough for him without that. Will nothing make you understand?\u201d",
            "\u201cEnough! enough! Mr. Terentieff,\u201d interrupted Gania.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t excite yourself; you seem very ill, and I am sorry for that. I am almost done, but there are a few facts to which I must briefly refer, as I am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once for all....\u201d A movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he resumed: \u201cI merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned, that the reason for Mr. Pavlicheff\u2019s interest in your mother, Mr. Burdovsky, was simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom he was deeply in love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would have married but for her sudden death. I have proofs that this circumstance is almost, if not quite, forgotten. I may add that when your mother was about ten years old, Pavlicheff took her under his care, gave her a good education, and later, a considerable dowry. His relations were alarmed, and feared he might go so far as to marry her, but she gave her hand to a young land-surveyor named Burdovsky when she reached the age of twenty. I can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection. After his wedding your father gave up his occupation as land-surveyor, and with his wife\u2019s dowry of fifteen thousand roubles went in for commercial speculations. As he had had no experience, he was cheated on all sides, and took to drink in order to forget his troubles. He shortened his life by his excesses, and eight years after his marriage he died. Your mother says herself that she was left in the direst poverty, and would have died of starvation had it not been for Pavlicheff, who generously allowed her a yearly pension of six hundred roubles. Many people recall his extreme fondness for you as a little boy. Your mother confirms this, and agrees with others in thinking that he loved you the more because you were a sickly child, stammering in your speech, and almost deformed\u2014for it is known that all his life Nicolai Andreevitch had a partiality for unfortunates of every kind, especially children. In my opinion this is most important. I may add that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my detective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,\u2014it was thanks to him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special teachers\u2014his relations and servants grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point out that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years of Pavlicheff\u2019s life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your mother\u2019s acquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports. What she does not know is that you, her son, should have listened to them so complaisantly. I found your respected mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since the death of your benefactor. She told me with tears of gratitude how you had supported her; she expects much of you, and believes fervently in your future success...\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, this is unbearable!\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew impatiently. \u201cWhat is the good of all this romancing?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is revolting and unseemly!\u201d cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury.",
            "Burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.",
            "\u201cWhat is the good of it?\u201d repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with pretended surprise. \u201cWell, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky is quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheff\u2019s love for him came simply from generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the article written by Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr. Burdovsky, as an honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago that I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the contrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. He looked at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the generosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff, and on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of honour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his principles, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with very little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and his other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth, progress, and humanity. In short, the conclusion may be drawn that, in spite of all appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of irreproachable character, and thus the prince can all the more readily offer him his friendship, and the assistance of which he spoke just now...\u201d",
            "\u201cHush! hush! Gavrila Ardalionovitch!\u201d cried Muishkin in dismay, but it was too late.",
            "\u201cI said, and I have repeated it over and over again,\u201d shouted Burdovsky furiously, \u201cthat I did not want the money. I will not take it... why...I will not... I am going away!\u201d",
            "He was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when Lebedeff\u2019s nephew seized his arms, and said something to him in a low voice. Burdovsky turned quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket, he threw it down on a little table beside the prince.",

And now I am again to blame. I offended you just now.\u201d (The prince was much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke almost incoherently.) \u201cI spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that to you. I was deceived .... I said you were... afflicted... like me... But you are not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother. I said you had dishonoured your mother, but you love her. She says so herself... I did not know... Gavrila Ardalionovitch did not tell me that... Forgive me! I dared to offer you ten thousand roubles, but I was wrong. I ought to have done it differently, and now... there is no way of doing it, for you despise me...\u201d",

He stood waiting for his wife with an air of offended dignity. Lebedeff\u2019s nephew took up the word again.",
            "\u201cWell, prince, to do you justice, you certainly know how to make the most of your\u2014let us call it infirmity, for the sake of politeness; you have set about offering your money and friendship in such a way that no self-respecting man could possibly accept them. This is an excess of ingenuousness or of malice\u2014you ought to know better than anyone which word best fits the case.\u201d",
            "\u201cAllow me, gentlemen,\u201d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who had just examined the contents of the envelope, \u201cthere are only a hundred roubles here, not two hundred and fifty. I point this out, prince, to prevent misunderstanding.\u201d",
            "\u201cNever mind, never mind,\u201d said the prince, signing to him to keep quiet.",
            "\u201cBut we do mind,\u201d said Lebedeff\u2019s nephew vehemently. \u201cPrince, your \u2018never mind\u2019 is an insult to us. We have nothing to hide; our actions can bear daylight. It is true that there are only a hundred roubles instead of two hundred and fifty, but it is all the same.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, no, it is hardly the same,\u201d remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with an air of ingenuous surprise.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, Mr. Lawyer,\u201d cried Lebedeff\u2019s nephew angrily. \u201cOf course there is a difference between a hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case the principle is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles are missing is only a side issue. The point to be emphasized is that Burdovsky will not accept your highness\u2019s charity; he flings it back in your face, and it scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or two hundred and fifty. Burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you heard him. He would not have returned even a hundred roubles if he was dishonest! The hundred and fifty roubles were paid to Tchebaroff for his travelling expenses. You may jeer at our stupidity and at our inexperience in business matters; you have done all you could already to make us look ridiculous; but do not dare to call us dishonest. The four of us will club together every day to repay the hundred and fifty roubles to the prince, if we have to pay it in instalments of a rouble at a time, but we will repay it, with interest. Burdovsky is poor, he has no millions. After his journey to see the prince Tchebaroff sent in his bill. We counted on winning... Who would not have done the same in such a case?\u201d",
            "\u201cWho indeed?\u201d exclaimed Prince S.",

            "\u201cIt reminds me,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, \u201cof the famous plea of a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people in order to rob them. He excused his client on the score of poverty. \u2018It is quite natural,\u2019 he said in conclusion, \u2018considering the state of misery he was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six people; which of you, gentlemen, would not have done the same in his place?\u2019\u201d",

She had restrained herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on somebody. Those who knew Lizabetha Prokofievna saw at once how it was with her. \u201cShe flies into these rages sometimes,\u201d said Ivan Fedorovitch to Prince S. the next day, \u201cbut she is not often so violent as she was yesterday; it does not happen more than once in three years.\u201d",
            "\u201cBe quiet, Ivan Fedorovitch! Leave me alone!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin. \u201cWhy do you offer me your arm now? You had not sense enough to take me away before. You are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag me away by force, if in my folly I refused to obey you and go quietly. You might at least have thought of your daughters. We can find our way out now without your help. Here is shame enough for a year! Wait a moment \u2018till I thank the prince! Thank you, prince, for the entertainment you have given us! It was most amusing to hear these young men... It is vile, vile! A chaos, a scandal, worse than a nightmare! Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth? Be quiet, Aglaya! Be quiet, Alexandra! It is none of your business! Don\u2019t fuss round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you exasperate me! So, my dear,\u201d she cried, addressing the prince, \u201cyou go so far as to beg their pardon! He says, \u2018Forgive me for offering you a fortune.\u2019 And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?\u201d she cried, turning suddenly on Lebedeff\u2019s nephew. \u201c\u2018We refuse ten thousand roubles; we do not beseech, we demand!\u2019 As if he did not know that this idiot will call on them tomorrow to renew his offers of money and friendship. You will, won\u2019t you? You will? Come, will you, or won\u2019t you?\u201d",

            "The girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively horrified. Mrs. Epanchin\u2019s language astonished everybody. Some who stood a little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers. Lebedeff wore an expression of utmost ecstasy.",

            "\u201cNot like this! Nothing like the spectacle you have just given us, sir,\u201d answered Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a sort of hysterical rage. \u201cLeave me alone, will you?\u201d she cried violently to those around her, who were trying to keep her quiet. \u201cNo, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you said yourself just now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it quite natural that a man should murder six people because he was in misery, the world must be coming to an end. I had not heard of it before. Now I understand everything. And this stutterer, won\u2019t he turn out a murderer?\u201d she cried, pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at her with stupefaction. \u201cI bet he will! He will have none of your money, possibly, he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him to accept it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off with your cashbox, with a clear conscience! He does not call it a dishonest action but \u2018the impulse of a noble despair\u2019; \u2018a negation\u2019; or the devil knows what! Bah! everything is upside down, everyone walks head downwards. A young girl, brought up at home, suddenly jumps into a cab in the middle of the street, saying: \u2018Good-bye, mother, I married Karlitch, or Ivanitch, the other day!\u2019 And you think it quite right? You call such conduct estimable and natural? The \u2018woman question\u2019? Look here,\u201d she continued, pointing to Colia, \u201cthe other day that whippersnapper told me that this was the whole meaning of the \u2018woman question.\u2019 But even supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none the less, bound to treat her with humanity. Why did you come here tonight so insolently? \u2018Give us our rights, but don\u2019t dare to speak in our presence. Show us every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you like the scum of the earth.\u2019 The miscreants have written a tissue of calumny in their article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and do battle for the right! \u2018We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no thanks from us, because you will be acting to satisfy your own conscience!\u2019 What morality! But, good heavens! if you declare that the prince\u2019s generosity will, excite no gratitude in you, he might answer that he is not, bound to be grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only satisfying his own conscience. But you counted on the prince\u2019s, gratitude towards Pavlicheff; you never lent him any money; he owes you nothing; then what were you counting upon if not on his gratitude? And if you appeal to that sentiment in others, why should you expect to be exempted from it? They are mad! They say society is savage and inhuman because it despises a young girl who has been seduced. But if you call society inhuman you imply that the young girl is made to suffer by its censure. How then, can you hold her up to the scorn of society in the newspapers without realizing that you are making her suffering, still greater? Madmen! Vain fools! They don\u2019t believe in God, they don\u2019t believe in Christ! But you are so eaten up by pride and vanity, that you will end by devouring each other\u2014that is my prophecy! Is not this absurd? Is it not monstrous chaos? And after all this, that shameless creature will go and beg their pardon! Are there many people like you? What are you smiling at? Because I am not ashamed to disgrace myself before you?\u2014Yes, I am disgraced\u2014it can\u2019t be helped now! But don\u2019t you jeer at me, you scum!\u201d (this was aimed at Hippolyte). \u201cHe is almost at his last gasp, yet he corrupts others. You, have got hold of this lad\u2014\u201d (she pointed to Colia); \u201cyou, have turned his head, you have taught him to be an atheist, you don\u2019t believe in God, and you are not too old to be whipped, sir! A plague upon you! And so, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, you will call on them tomorrow, will you?\u201d she asked the prince breathlessly, for the second time.",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",

            "\u201cSo I will,\u201d he whispered hoarsely. \u201cAs soon as I get home I will go to bed at once; and I know I shall be dead in a fortnight; Botkine told me so himself last week. That is why I should like to say a few farewell words, if you will let me.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut you must be mad! It is ridiculous! You should take care of yourself; what is the use of holding a conversation now? Go home to bed, do!\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin in horror.",
            "\u201cWhen I do go to bed I shall never get up again,\u201d said Hippolyte, with a smile. \u201cI meant to take to my bed yesterday and stay there till I died, but as my legs can still carry me, I put it off for two days, so as to come here with them to-day\u2014but I am very tired.\u201d",

We must have a talk now, Lizabetha Prokofievna; I am very anxious for it.\u201d He smiled at her once more. \u201cRemember that today, for the last time, I am out in the air, and in the company of my fellow-men, and that in a fortnight I shall certainly be no longer in this world. So, in a way, this is my farewell to nature and to men. I am not very sentimental, but do you know, I am quite glad that all this has happened at Pavlofsk, where at least one can see a green tree.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut why talk now?\u201d replied Lizabetha Prokofievna, more and more alarmed; \u201cYou are quite feverish. Just now you would not stop shouting, and now you can hardly breathe. You are gasping.\u201d",
            "\u201cI shall have time to rest. Why will you not grant my last wish? Do you know, Lizabetha Prokofievna, that I have dreamed of meeting you for a long while? I had often heard of you from Colia; he is almost the only person who still comes to see me. You are an original and eccentric woman; I have seen that for myself\u2014Do you know, I have even been rather fond of you?\u201d",

She is so beautiful that I recognized her directly, although I had never seen her before. Let me, at least, look on beauty for the last time in my life,\u201d he said with a wry smile. \u201cYou are here with the prince, and your husband, and a large company. Why should you refuse to gratify my last wish?\u201d",
            "\u201cGive me a chair!\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, but she seized one for herself and sat down opposite to Hippolyte. \u201cColia, you must go home with him,\u201d she commanded, \u201cand tomorrow I will come my self.\u201d",
            "\u201cWill you let me ask the prince for a cup of tea?... I am exhausted. Do you know what you might do, Lizabetha Prokofievna? I think you wanted to take the prince home with you for tea. Stay here, and let us spend the evening together. I am sure the prince will give us all some tea. Forgive me for being so free and easy\u2014but I know you are kind, and the prince is kind, too. In fact, we are all good-natured people\u2014it is really quite comical.\u201d",
            "The prince bestirred himself to give orders. Lebedeff hurried out, followed by Vera.",
            "\u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin decisively. \u201cTalk, but not too loud, and don\u2019t excite yourself. You have made me sorry for you. Prince, you don\u2019t deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet I will, all the same, but I won\u2019t apologize. I apologize to nobody! Nobody! It is absurd! However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you up\u2014that is, if you like, of course. But please don\u2019t let me keep anyone,\u201d she added suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of resentment, as though they had grievously offended her. \u201cI can come home alone quite well.\u201d",
            "But they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly. The prince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized for not having thought of it before. The general murmured a few polite words, and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the terrace. He very nearly asked Hippolyte how long he had been at the University, but stopped himself in time. Evgenie Pavlovitch and Prince S. suddenly grew extremely gay and amiable. Adelaida and Alexandra had not recovered from their surprise, but it was now mingled with satisfaction; in short, everyone seemed very much relieved that Lizabetha Prokofievna had got over her paroxysm. Aglaya alone still frowned, and sat apart in silence. All the other guests stayed on as well; no one wanted to go, not even General Ivolgin, but Lebedeff said something to him in passing which did not seem to please him, for he immediately went and sulked in a corner. The prince took care to offer tea to Burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest. The invitation made them rather uncomfortable. They muttered that they would wait for Hippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant corner of the verandah. Tea was served at once; Lebedeff had no doubt ordered it for himself and his family before the others arrived. It was striking eleven. "

To clear the matter up, I declare now that I did have recourse to his assistance, and that I paid him six roubles for it. But I did not ask him to correct my style; I simply went to him for information concerning the facts, of which I was ignorant to a great extent, and which he was competent to give. The story of the gaiters, the appetite in the Swiss professor\u2019s house, the substitution of fifty roubles for two hundred and fifty\u2014all such details, in fact, were got from him.

Everyone can understand that a collection of such strange young men would attract the attention of a person interested in contemporary life. I stayed myself, just as I sometimes stop to look on in the street when I see something that may be regarded as-as-as-\u201d",
            "\u201cAs a curiosity,\u201d suggested Evgenie Pavlovitch, seeing his excellency involved in a comparison which he could not complete.",
            "\u201cThat is exactly the word I wanted,\u201d said the general with satisfaction\u2014\u201ca curiosity. However, the most astonishing and, if I may so express myself, the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you cannot even understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only stayed with you because you are ill,\u2014if you really are dying\u2014moved by the pity awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her name, character, and social position place her above all risk of contamination. Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d he continued, now crimson with rage, \u201cif you are coming, we will say goodnight to the prince, and\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cThank you for the lesson, general,\u201d said Hippolyte, with unexpected gravity, regarding him thoughtfully.",
            "\u201cTwo minutes more, if you please, dear Ivan Fedorovitch,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna to her husband; \u201cit seems to me that he is in a fever and delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it is impossible to let him go back to Petersburg tonight. Can you put him up, Lef Nicolaievitch? I hope you are not bored, dear prince,\u201d she added suddenly to Prince S. \u201cAlexandra, my dear, come here! Your hair is coming down.\u201d",
            "She arranged her daughter\u2019s hair, which was not in the least disordered, and gave her a kiss. This was all that she had called her for.",
            "\u201cI thought you were capable of development,\u201d said Hippolyte, coming out of his fit of abstraction. \u201cYes, that is what I meant to say,\u201d he added, with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had forgotten. \u201cHere is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother; is not that so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace. The prince is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum of money, in the sincerity of his heart. And here they stand like two sworn enemies\u2014ha, ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not? Is not that true? Is it not true? You all have a passion for beauty and distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for, isn\u2019t it? I have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else! Well, let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As to you, prince, I know that you have sent money secretly to Burdovsky\u2019s mother through Gania. Well, I bet now,\u201d he continued with an hysterical laugh, \u201cthat Burdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother! Yes, that is quite certain! Ha, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "He caught his breath, and began to cough once more.",
            "\u201cCome, that is enough! That is all now; you have no more to say? Now go to bed; you are burning with fever,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna impatiently. Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. \u201cGood heavens, he is going to begin again!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are laughing, I think? Why do you keep laughing at me?\u201d said Hippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing.",
            "\u201cI only want to know, Mr. Hippolyte\u2014excuse me, I forget your surname.\u201d",
            "\u201cMr. Terentieff,\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cOh yes, Mr. Terentieff. Thank you prince. I heard it just now, but had forgotten it. I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard about you is true. It seems you are convinced that if you could speak to the people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make them all adopt your views and follow you?\u201d",
            "\u201cI may have said so,\u201d answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember. \u201cYes, I certainly said so,\u201d he continued with sudden animation, fixing an unflinching glance on his questioner. \u201cWhat of it?\u201d",
            "\u201cNothing. I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing touch.\u201d",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed upon him, waiting impatiently for more.",
            "\u201cWell, have you finished?\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie. \u201cMake haste, sir; it is time he went to bed. Have you more to say?\u201d She was very angry.",
            "\u201cYes, I have a little more,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile. \u201cIt seems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff, and all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be summed up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything else, to the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered what constitutes the right. I may be mistaken?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you. What else?\u201d",
            "Murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions; Lebedeff\u2019s nephew protested under his breath.",
            "\u201cI have nearly finished,\u201d replied Evgenie Pavlovitch.",
            "\u201cI will only remark that from these premises one could conclude that might is right\u2014I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal inclination. Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion. Prudhon upheld that might is right. In the American War some of the most advanced Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that the blacks were an inferior race to the whites, and that might was the right of the white race.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat then?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are at least logical. I would only point out that from the right of might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and Gorsky, is but a step.\u201d",
            "\u201cI know nothing about that; what else?\u201d",
            "Hippolyte was scarcely listening. He kept saying \u201cwell?\u201d and \u201cwhat else?\u201d mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of habit.",
            "\u201cWhy, nothing else; that is all.\u201d",
            "\u201cHowever, I bear you no grudge,\u201d said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly conscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile. The gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness.",
            "\u201cI can but thank you,\u201d he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere, \u201cfor your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that our Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own, and immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat you say is quite true,\u201d observed General Epanchin; then, clasping his hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace steps, where he yawned with an air of boredom.",
            "\u201cCome, sir, that will do; you weary me,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch.",
            "Hippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened.",
            "\u201cIt is time for me to go,\u201d he said, glancing round in perplexity. \u201cI have detained you... I wanted to tell you everything... I thought you all... for the last time... it was a whim...\u201d",
            "He evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke from his semi-delirium; then, recovering full self-possession for a few moments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps haunted him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary, sleepless nights.",
            "\u201cWell, good-bye,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cYou think it is easy for me to say good-bye to you? Ha, ha!\u201d",
            "Feeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily. Then as if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he said irritably, in a loud voice:",
            "\u201cExcellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is, if you will deign to honour it with your presence. I invite you all, gentlemen, as well as the general.\u201d",
            "He burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman. Lizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm. He stared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew serious.",
            "\u201cDo you know that I came here to see those trees?\u201d pointing to the trees in the park. \u201cIt is not ridiculous, is it? Say that it is not ridiculous!\u201d he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna. Then he seemed to be plunged in thought. A moment later he raised his head, and his eyes sought for someone. He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was close by on his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and his eyes ranged over the assembled company. \u201cAh! you have not gone!\u201d he said, when he caught sight of him at last. \u201cYou kept on laughing just now, because I thought of speaking to the people from the window for a quarter of an hour. But I am not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed, and looking out of that window, I have thought of all sorts of things for such a long time that... a dead man has no age, you know. I was saying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night. Do you know what you fear most? You fear our sincerity more than anything, although you despise us! The idea crossed my mind that night... You thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna? No, the idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you. Colia told me the prince called you a child\u2014very well\u2014but let me see, I had something else to say...\u201d He covered his face with his hands and tried to collect his thoughts.",
            "\u201cAh, yes\u2014you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: \u2018I shall never see these people again\u2014never again! This is the last time I shall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red brick wall of Meyer\u2019s house opposite my window. Tell them about it\u2014try to tell them,\u2019 I thought. \u2018Here is a beautiful young girl\u2014you are a dead man; make them understand that. Tell them that a dead man may say anything\u2014and Mrs. Grundy will not be angry\u2014ha-ha! You are not laughing?\u201d He looked anxiously around. \u201cBut you know I get so many queer ideas, lying there in bed. I have grown convinced that nature is full of mockery\u2014you called me an atheist just now, but you know this nature... why are you laughing again? You are very cruel!\u201d he added suddenly, regarding them all with mournful reproach. \u201cI have not corrupted Colia,\u201d he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as if remembering something again.",
            "\u201cNobody here is laughing at you. Calm yourself,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, much moved. \u201cYou shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the other was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that! You are delirious\u2014\u201d Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she made him sit down again in the arm-chair.",
            "A tear glistened on her cheek. At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed amazed. He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his finger, smiling like a child.",
            "\u201cI... you,\u201d he began joyfully. \u201cYou cannot tell how I... he always spoke so enthusiastically of you, Colia here; I liked his enthusiasm. I was not corrupting him! But I must leave him, too\u2014I wanted to leave them all\u2014there was not one of them\u2014not one! I wanted to be a man of action\u2014I had a right to be. Oh! what a lot of things I wanted! Now I want nothing; I renounce all my wants; I swore to myself that I would want nothing; let them seek the truth without me! Yes, nature is full of mockery! Why\u201d\u2014he continued with sudden warmth\u2014\u201cdoes she create the choicest beings only to mock at them? The only human being who is recognized as perfect, when nature showed him to mankind, was given the mission to say things which have caused the shedding of so much blood that it would have drowned mankind if it had all been shed at once! Oh! it is better for me to die! I should tell some dreadful lie too; nature would so contrive it! I have corrupted nobody. I wanted to live for the happiness of all men, to find and spread the truth. I used to look out of my window at the wall of Meyer\u2019s house, and say to myself that if I could speak for a quarter of an hour I would convince the whole world, and now for once in my life I have come into contact with... you\u2014if not with the others! And what is the result? Nothing! The sole result is that you despise me! Therefore I must be a fool, I am useless, it is time I disappeared! And I shall leave not even a memory! Not a sound, not a trace, not a single deed! I have not spread a single truth!... Do not laugh at the fool! Forget him! Forget him forever! I beseech you, do not be so cruel as to remember! Do you know that if I were not consumptive, I would kill myself?\u201d",
            "Though he seemed to wish to say much more, he became silent. He fell back into his chair, and, covering his face with his hands, began to sob like a little child.",
            "\u201cOh! what on earth are we to do with him?\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna. She hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he sobbed convulsively.",
            "\u201cCome, come, come! There, you must not cry, that will do. You are a good child! God will forgive you, because you knew no better. Come now, be a man! You know presently you will be ashamed.\u201d",
            "Hippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:",
            "\u201cI have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent. She will corrupt them! You are a saint! You are a child yourself\u2014save them! Snatch them from that... she is... it is shameful! Oh! help them! God will repay you a hundredfold. For the love of God, for the love of Christ!\u201d",
            "\u201cSpeak, Ivan Fedorovitch! What are we to do?\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, irritably. \u201cPlease break your majestic silence! I tell you, if you cannot come to some decision, I will stay here all night myself. You have tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!\u201d",
            "She spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate reply. But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer to keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their comments till afterwards. There were some present\u2014Varvara Ardalionovna, for instance\u2014who would have willingly sat there till morning without saying a word. Varvara had sat apart all the evening without opening her lips, but she listened to everything with the closest attention; perhaps she had her reasons for so doing.",
            "\u201cMy dear,\u201d said the general, \u201cit seems to me that a sick-nurse would be of more use here than an excitable person like you. Perhaps it would be as well to get some sober, reliable man for the night. In any case we must consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once. Tomorrow we can see what can be done for him.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is nearly midnight; we are going. Will he come with us, or is he to stay here?\u201d Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince.",
            "\u201cYou can stay with him if you like,\u201d said Muishkin.",
            "\u201cThere is plenty of room here.\u201d",
            "Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the general.",
            "\u201cExcellency,\u201d he said, impulsively, \u201cif you want a reliable man for the night, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friend\u2014such a soul as he has! I have long thought him a great man, excellency! My article showed my lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!\u201d",
            "Ivan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair.",
            "\u201cI shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult for him to get back to Petersburg,\u201d said the prince, in answer to the eager questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna.",
            "\u201cBut you are half asleep, are you not? If you don\u2019t want him, I will take him back to my house! Why, good gracious! He can hardly stand up himself! What is it? Are you ill?\u201d",
            "Not finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been misled by his appearance to think him much better than he was. But his recent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of this evening, the incident with \u201cPavlicheff\u2019s son,\u201d and now this scene with Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he was now almost in a fever. Moreover, a new trouble, almost a fear, showed itself in his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something further.",
            "Suddenly Hippolyte arose. His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man overwhelmed with shame and despair. This was shown chiefly in the look of fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the wild smile upon his trembling lips. Then he cast down his eyes, and with the same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who stood at the entrance to the verandah. He had decided to go with them.",
            "\u201cThere! that is what I feared!\u201d cried the prince. \u201cIt was inevitable!\u201d",
            "Hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the muscles of his face quivering.",
            "\u201cAh! that is what you feared! It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me tell you that if I hate anyone here\u2014I hate you all,\u201d he cried, in a hoarse, strained voice\u2014\u201cbut you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire\u2014I hate you worse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated you long ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole heart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state! You have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause of my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not want your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear? Not from any one! I want nothing! I was delirious, do not dare to triumph! I curse every one of you, once for all!\u201d",
            "Breath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop.",
            "\u201cHe is ashamed of his tears!\u201d whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha Prokofievna. \u201cIt was inevitable. Ah! what a wonderful man the prince is! He read his very soul.\u201d",
            "But Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff. Drawn up haughtily, with her head held high, she gazed at the \u201criff-raff,\u201d with scornful curiosity. When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch shrugged his shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as if to demand the meaning of his movement. Then she turned to the prince.",
            "\u201cThanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the pleasant evening you have provided for us. I am sure you are quite pleased that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary affairs. It is quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving us an opportunity of getting to know you so well.\u201d",
            "She arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she waited for the \u201criff-raff\u201d to go. The cab which Lebedeff\u2019s son had gone to fetch a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenko\u2019s order, arrived at that moment. The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.",
            "\u201cReally, prince, I hardly expected after\u2014after all our friendly intercourse\u2014and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cPapa, how can you?\u201d cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince and holding out her hand.",
            "He smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in his ear as an angry voice whispered:",
            "\u201cIf you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very instant, I shall hate you all my life\u2014all my life!\u201d It was Aglaya. She seemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could look at her. However, there was no one left to turn out of the house, for they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it had driven off.",
            "\u201cWell, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch? What do you think? Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?\u201d",
            "\u201cMy dear, I am quite ready; naturally... the prince.\u201d",
            "Ivan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife, who was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had time to shake it. Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to their host with sincere friendliness. Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same, and he alone seemed in good spirits.",
            "\u201cWhat I expected has happened! But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that you should have had to suffer for it,\u201d he murmured, with a most charming smile.",
            "Aglaya left without saying good-bye. But the evening was not to end without a last adventure. An unexpected meeting was yet in store for Lizabetha Prokofievna.",
            "She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road that skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart open carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed some ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see.",
            "\u201cEvgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?\u201d cried a clear, sweet voice, which caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. \u201cWell, I _am_ glad I\u2019ve found you at last! I\u2019ve sent to town for you twice today myself! My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!\u201d",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning. Mrs. Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of Evgenie. She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed her companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie himself.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s news!\u201d continued the clear voice. \u201cYou need not be anxious about Kupferof\u2019s IOU\u2019s\u2014Rogojin has bought them up. I persuaded him to!\u2014I dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so it\u2019s all right, you see! _Au revoir_, tomorrow! And don\u2019t worry!\u201d The carriage moved on, and disappeared.",
            "\u201cThe woman\u2019s mad!\u201d cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and looking confusedly around. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about! What IOU\u2019s? Who is she?\u201d Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a couple of seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards her own house, the rest following her.",
            "A minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in great agitation.",
            "\u201cPrince,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me the truth; do you know what all this means?\u201d",
            "\u201cI know nothing whatever about it!\u201d replied the latter, who was, himself, in a state of nervous excitement.",
            "\u201cNo?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo!\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, nor do I!\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest knowledge of any such IOU\u2019s as she mentioned, I swear I haven\u2019t\u2014What\u2019s the matter, are you fainting?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, no\u2014no\u2014I\u2019m all right, I assure you!\u201d "

            "By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and Evgenie Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in his mind. He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of this new \u201cmonstrosity,\u201d or was it... but he refrained from saying who else might be in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischief\u2014so childish that he felt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any importance to it.",
            "The day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the honour of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S. They came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health. They had wandered out for a walk, and called in \u201cby accident,\u201d and talked for almost the whole of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This, and a little amiable conversation on Prince S.\u2019s part, occupied the time, and not a word was said about last evening\u2019s episodes. At length Adelaida burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had come incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said nothing about the prince\u2019s either walking back with them or coming to see them later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchin\u2019s black books. Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like to show him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or bring it herself the next day\u2014which to the prince seemed very suggestive.",
            "At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing, Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. \u201cOh yes, by-the-by,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, who that lady was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt was Nastasia Philipovna,\u201d said the prince; \u201cdidn\u2019t you know that? I cannot tell you who her companion was.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle to me\u2014to me, and to others, too!\u201d Prince S. seemed to be under the influence of sincere astonishment.",
            "\u201cShe spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s,\u201d said the prince, simply, \u201cwhich Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that Rogojin would not press him.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly absurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOU\u2019s to a money-lender, and to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave us to understand; that\u2019s the principal part of the mystery! He has given me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and of course I believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know anything about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it come across you?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I know nothing whatever about it. I assure you I had nothing at all to do with it.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, prince, how strange you have become! I assure you, I hardly know you for your old self. How can you suppose that I ever suggested you could have had a finger in such a business? But you are not quite yourself today, I can see.\u201d He embraced the prince, and kissed him.",
            "\u201cWhat do you mean, though,\u201d asked Muishkin, \u201c\u2018by such a business\u2019? I don\u2019t see any particular \u2018business\u2019 about it at all!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to do Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him\u2014before witnesses\u2014qualities which he neither has nor can have,\u201d replied Prince S. drily enough.",
            "Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and questioningly into Prince S.\u2019s face. The latter, however, remained silent.",
            "\u201cThen it was not simply a matter of bills?\u201d Muishkin said at last, with some impatience. \u201cIt was not as she said?\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between Evgenie Pavlovitch, and\u2014her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he is a man of immense wealth\u2014as I know for a fact; and he has further expectations from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovna\u2014\u201d",
            "Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia Philipovna.",
            "\u201cThen at all events he knows her!\u201d remarked the prince, after a moment\u2019s silence.",
            "\u201cOh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago\u2014two or three years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the place\u2014many people don\u2019t even know that she has returned from Moscow! I have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely carriage,\u201d said Adelaida.",
            "\u201cYes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!\u201d",
            "The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his suspicions and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S. was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to be an intrigue of some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. At all events, nothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him of being concerned in the affair. And if all this were so, then _she_ must have some terrible object in view! What was it? There was no stopping _her_, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of anything she had set her mind on! \u201cOh, she is mad, mad!\u201d thought the poor prince.",
            "But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera Lebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her younger sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by. He informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new interpretation of the star called \u201cwormwood,\u201d which fell upon the water-springs, as described in the Apocalypse. He had decided that it meant the network of railroads spread over the face of Europe at the present time. The prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have given such an interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at the earliest opportunity. Vera related how Keller had taken up his abode with them on the previous evening. She thought he would remain for some time, as he was greatly pleased with the society of General Ivolgin and of the whole family. But he declared that he had only come to them in order to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed the company of Lebedeff\u2019s children, and today it was especially welcome, for Colia did not appear all day. Early that morning he had started for Petersburg. Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila Ardalionovitch had promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming.",
            "About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the details of last night\u2019s affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship between him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed the Burdovsky affair in his hands\u2014and this was not the only mark of confidence he had received\u2014it seemed curious how many matters there were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness. It was apparent now, when he entered, that he was convinced that the moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.",
            "But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at Lebedeff\u2019s to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was soon undeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little absent-minded, and asked none of the questions\u2014one in particular\u2014that Gania had expected. So he imitated the prince\u2019s demeanour, and talked fast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their thoughts were engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that Nastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that everyone was talking about her already. She was staying with Daria Alexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove about in the smartest carriage in the place. A crowd of followers had pursued her from the first, young and old. Some escorted her on horse-back when she took the air in her carriage.",
            "She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and admitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need. One gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her account, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the same reason.",
            "She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen, a distant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in fact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house. Nastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She dressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in Pavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her carriage and horses.",
            "\u201cAs for yesterday\u2019s episode,\u201d continued Gania, \u201cof course it was pre-arranged.\u201d Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how he knew that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie Pavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the former had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had probably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these four days. As to the question of the IOU\u2019s she had spoken of, there might easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly a man of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in disorder. Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off, and said no more about Nastasia\u2019s prank of the previous evening.",
            "At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and remained for a few minutes. Without Muishkin\u2019s asking her, she informed him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and perhaps would remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also gone to town, probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s affairs.",
            "\u201cLizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today,\u201d she added, as she went out, \u201cbut the most curious thing is that Aglaya has quarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother, but with her sisters also. It is not a good sign.\u201d She said all this quite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of the prince, and went off with her brother. Regarding the episode of \u201cPavlicheff\u2019s son,\u201d Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a kind of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to \u201cspare the prince\u2019s feelings.\u201d The latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he had taken in the affair.",
            "Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden, crossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to make up his mind as to a certain \u201cstep.\u201d This step was one of those things, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for or against hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a longing to leave all this and go away\u2014go anywhere, if only it were far enough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a presentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and among these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and permanently. However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away was impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay before him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at least to refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to solve them. Having come to this determination, he turned and went home, his walk having lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At that moment he was thoroughly unhappy.",
            "Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to penetrate into the prince\u2019s apartments. He was not drunk, but in a confidential and talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell the story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk for that purpose. There was no means of turning him out; nothing short of an earthquake would have removed him.",
            "In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history; but after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which was that \u201chaving ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every vestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft.\u201d \u201cCould you imagine such a thing?\u201d said he.",
            "\u201cListen to me, Keller,\u201d returned the prince. \u201cIf I were in your place, I should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for some reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than you are, purposely?\u201d",
            "\u201cI should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it now as a help to my soul\u2019s evolution. When I die, that secret will die with me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea, how difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the question. Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: \u2018Give us gold, jewels, or diamonds, and it will be quite easy.\u2019 Exactly what one has not got! Can you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and said, \u2018I suppose you would accept emeralds?\u2019 \u2018Certainly, we accept emeralds with pleasure. Yes!\u2019 \u2018Well, that\u2019s all right,\u2019 said I. \u2018Go to the devil, you den of thieves!\u2019 And with that I seized my hat, and walked out.\u201d",
            "\u201cHad you any emeralds?\u201d asked the prince.",
            "\u201cWhat? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what almost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!\u201d",
            "Could not something be made of this man under good influences? asked the prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor. He thought little of the value of his own personal influence, not from a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at things in general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated and more interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring it to a close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having been guilty of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince that he could mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he professed the deepest repentance, and described himself as being \u201cbathed in tears\u201d; but this did not prevent him from putting on a boastful air at times, and some of his stories were so absurdly comical that both he and the prince laughed like madmen.",
            "\u201cOne point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind, and extreme truthfulness,\u201d said the prince at last. \u201cDo you know that that atones for much?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!\u201d said Keller, much softened. \u201cBut, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a dream, if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now, why is that? I can never understand.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving ourselves, that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life. I, at least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have just told me.\u201d",
            "\u201cImpossible?\u201d cried Keller, almost pityingly. \u201cOh prince, how little you really seem to understand human nature!\u201d",
            "\u201cIs there really much more to be added?\u201d asked the prince, with mild surprise. \u201cWell, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me why you came to make your confession to me?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like you. It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for one of the best of men... and then... then...\u201d",
            "He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped him out.",
            "\u201cThen you wanted me to lend you money?\u201d",
            "The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.",
            "Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the table with his fist.",
            "\u201cWell, prince, that\u2019s enough to knock me down! It astounds me! Here you are, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet... yet... you read a man\u2019s soul like a psychologist! Now, do explain it to me, prince, because I... I really do not understand!... Of course, my aim was to borrow money all along, and you... you asked the question as if there was nothing blameable in it\u2014as if you thought it quite natural.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes... from you it is quite natural.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd you are not offended?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy should I be offended?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, just listen, prince. I remained here last evening, partly because I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue. I enjoyed a discussion over him till three o\u2019clock in the morning, with Lebedeff; and then... then\u2014I swear by all I hold sacred that I am telling you the truth\u2014then I wished to develop my soul in this frank and heartfelt confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing myself to sleep at dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in my soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea from hell struck me. \u2018Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?\u2019 You see, this confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended to use it as a means to your good grace and favour\u2014and then\u2014then I meant to walk off with a hundred and fifty roubles. Now, do you not call that base?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is hardly an exact statement of the case,\u201d said the prince in reply. \u201cYou have confused your motives and ideas, as I need scarcely say too often happens to myself. I can assure you, Keller, I reproach myself bitterly for it sometimes. When you were talking just now I seemed to be listening to something about myself. At times I have imagined that all men were the same,\u201d he continued earnestly, for he appeared to be much interested in the conversation, \u201cand that consoled me in a certain degree, for a _double_ motive is a thing most difficult to fight against. I have tried, and I know. God knows whence they arise, these ideas that you speak of as base. I fear these double motives more than ever just now, but I am not your judge, and in my opinion it is going too far to give the name of baseness to it\u2014what do you think? You were going to employ your tears as a ruse in order to borrow money, but you also say\u2014in fact, you have sworn to the fact\u2014that independently of this your confession was made with an honourable motive. As for the money, you want it for drink, do you not? After your confession, that is weakness, of course; but, after all, how can anyone give up a bad habit at a moment\u2019s notice? It is impossible. What can we do? It is best, I think, to leave the matter to your own conscience. How does it seem to you?\u201d As he concluded the prince looked curiously at Keller; evidently this problem of double motives had often been considered by him before.",
            "\u201cWell, how anybody can call you an idiot after that, is more than I can understand!\u201d cried the boxer.",
            "The prince reddened slightly.",
            "\u201cBourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me,\u201d Keller continued, \u201cbut you, you have judged me with humanity. To show how grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and fifty roubles. Give me twenty-five\u2014that will be enough; it is all I really need, for a fortnight at least. I will not ask you for more for a fortnight. I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does not really deserve it. Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!\u201d",
            "At this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg. He frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Keller\u2019s hand, but the latter, having got the money, went away at once. Lebedeff began to abuse him.",
            "\u201cYou are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant,\u201d observed the prince, after listening for a time.",
            "\u201cWhat is the good of repentance like that? It is the same exactly as mine yesterday, when I said, \u2018I am base, I am base,\u2019\u2014words, and nothing more!\u201d",
            "\u201cThen they were only words on your part? I thought, on the contrary...\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind telling you the truth\u2014you only! Because you see through a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people. It is always there\u2014the notion of cheating people, and of using my repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth, prince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh and jeer at me\u2014but you, you judge a man humanely.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few minutes ago!\u201d cried Muishkin. \u201cAnd you both seem inclined to boast about it! You astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for you make a regular trade of it. Oh, don\u2019t put on that pathetic expression, and don\u2019t put your hand on your heart! Have you anything to say to me? You have not come for nothing...\u201d",
            "Lebedeff grinned and wriggled.",
            "\u201cI have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a question; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once. Had you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?\u201d",
            "Lebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not a word in reply.",
            "\u201cI see you had something to do with it.\u201d",
            "\u201cIndirectly, quite indirectly! I am speaking the truth\u2014I am indeed! I merely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that such and such personages might be found among them.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am aware that you sent your son to that house\u2014he told me so himself just now, but what is this intrigue?\u201d said the prince, impatiently.",
            "\u201cIt is not my intrigue!\u201d cried Lebedeff, waving his hand.",
            "\u201cIt was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a fantasy than an intrigue!\u201d",
            "\u201cBut what is it all about? Tell me, for Heaven\u2019s sake! Cannot you understand how nearly it touches me? Why are they blackening Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s reputation?\u201d",
            "Lebedeff grimaced and wriggled again.",
            "\u201cPrince!\u201d said he. \u201cExcellency! You won\u2019t let me tell you the whole truth; I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you have not allowed me to go on...\u201d",
            "The prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought. Evidently he was struggling to decide.",
            "\u201cVery well! Tell me the truth,\u201d he said, dejectedly.",
            "\u201cAglaya Ivanovna...\u201d began Lebedeff, promptly.",
            "\u201cBe silent! At once!\u201d interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and perhaps with shame, too. \u201cIt is impossible and absurd! All that has been invented by you, or fools like you! Let me never hear you say a word again on that subject!\u201d",
            "Late in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and Pavlofsk news. He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it, which consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but passed quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings. He had gone straight to the Epanchins\u2019 from the station.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s the deuce and all going on there!\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all about the row last night, and I think there must be something new as well, though I didn\u2019t like to ask. Not a word about _you_, prince, the whole time! The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling with her people about Gania. Colia did not know any details, except that it had been a terrible quarrel! Also Evgenie Pavlovitch had called, and met with an excellent reception all round. And another curious thing: Mrs. Epanchin was so angry that she called Varia to her\u2014Varia was talking to the girls\u2014and turned her out of the house \u2018once for all\u2019 she said. I heard it from Varia herself\u2014Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite, but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them nothing about it, and they didn\u2019t know they were saying goodbye for the last time. I\u2019m sorry for Varia, and for Gania too; he isn\u2019t half a bad fellow, in spite of his faults, and I shall never forgive myself for not liking him before! I don\u2019t know whether I ought to continue to go to the Epanchins\u2019 now,\u201d concluded Colia\u2014\u201cI like to be quite independent of others, and of other people\u2019s quarrels if I can; but I must think over it.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t think you need break your heart over Gania,\u201d said the prince; \u201cfor if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the Epanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been encouraged.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat? What hopes?\u201d cried Colia; \u201cyou surely don\u2019t mean Aglaya?\u2014oh, no!\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYou\u2019re a dreadful sceptic, prince,\u201d he continued, after a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cI have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about everything. You don\u2019t seem to believe in people as you did, and are always attributing motives and so on\u2014am I using the word \u2018sceptic\u2019 in its proper sense?\u201d",
            "\u201cI believe so; but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll change it, right or wrong; I\u2019ll say that you are not sceptical, but _jealous_. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania, over a certain proud damsel! Come!\u201d Colia jumped up, with these words, and burst out laughing. He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before, and still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. He was delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya. However, he stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.",
            "Next day the prince had to go to town, on business. Returning in the afternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station. The latter seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid of being caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class compartment. He was burning to speak about something of importance.",
            "\u201cIn the first place, my dear prince, don\u2019t be angry with me. I would have come to see you yesterday, but I didn\u2019t know how Lizabetha Prokofievna would take it. My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell just now, a sort of sphinx has taken up its abode there. We live in an atmosphere of riddles; I can\u2019t make head or tail of anything. As for you, I feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us, though you certainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble. You see, it\u2019s all very pleasant to be a philanthropist; but it can be carried too far. Of course I admire kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, but\u2014\u201d",
            "The general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it was clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he could make nothing of.",
            "\u201cIt is plain to me, that _you_ are not in it at all,\u201d he continued, at last, a little less vaguely, \u201cbut perhaps you had better not come to our house for a little while. I ask you in the friendliest manner, mind; just till the wind changes again. As for Evgenie Pavlovitch,\u201d he continued with some excitement, \u201cthe whole thing is a calumny, a dirty calumny. It is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to stir up a quarrel. You see, prince, I\u2019ll tell you privately, Evgenie and ourselves have not said a word yet, we have no formal understanding, we are in no way bound on either side, but the word may be said very soon, don\u2019t you see, _very_ soon, and all this is most injurious, and is meant to be so. Why? I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t tell you. She\u2019s an extraordinary woman, you see, an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so frightened of that woman that I can\u2019t sleep. What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh? I declare, I was base enough to suspect Evgenie at first; but it seems certain that that cannot be the case, and if so, why is she interfering here? That\u2019s the riddle, what does she want? Is it to keep Evgenie to herself? But, my dear fellow, I swear to you, I swear he doesn\u2019t even _know_ her, and as for those bills, why, the whole thing is an invention! And the familiarity of the woman! It\u2019s quite clear we must treat the impudent creature\u2019s attempt with disdain, and redouble our courtesy towards Evgenie. I told my wife so.",
            "\u201cNow I\u2019ll tell you my secret conviction. I\u2019m certain that she\u2019s doing this to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure you that all the time I was blameless. I blush at the very idea. And now she turns up again like this, when I thought she had finally disappeared! Where\u2019s Rogojin all this time? I thought she was Mrs. Rogojin, long ago.\u201d",
            "The old man was in a state of great mental perturbation. The whole of the journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this strain, putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his shoulders, pressing the prince\u2019s hand, and assuring the latter that, at all events, he had no suspicion whatever of _him_. This last assurance was satisfactory, at all events. The general finished by informing him that Evgenie\u2019s uncle was head of one of the civil service departments, and rich, very rich, and a gourmand. \u201cAnd, well, Heaven preserve him, of course\u2014but Evgenie gets his money, don\u2019t you see? But, for all this, I\u2019m uncomfortable, I don\u2019t know why. There\u2019s something in the air, I feel there\u2019s something nasty in the air, like a bat, and I\u2019m by no means comfortable.\u201d",

It\u2019s a most improper note, I call it; most improper for such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. H\u2019m! I dare say she was annoyed that you didn\u2019t come; but she ought to have known that one can\u2019t write like that to an idiot like you, for you\u2019d be sure to take it literally.\u201d Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her all the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. \u201cWhat are you listening for?\u201d she added, seeing that she had committed herself a little. \u201cShe wants a clown like you\u2014she hasn\u2019t seen one for some time\u2014to play with. That\u2019s why she is anxious for you to come to the house. And right glad I am that she\u2019ll make a thorough good fool of you.

            "There was nothing premeditated, there was not even any conscious purpose in it all, and yet, in spite of everything, the family, although highly respected, was not quite what every highly respected family ought to be. For a long time now Lizabetha Prokofievna had had it in her mind that all the trouble was owing to her \u201cunfortunate character,\u201d and this added to her distress. She blamed her own stupid unconventional \u201ceccentricity.\u201d Always restless, always on the go, she constantly seemed to lose her way, and to get into trouble over the simplest and more ordinary affairs of life.",
            "We said at the beginning of our story, that the Epanchins were liked and esteemed by their neighbours. In spite of his humble origin, Ivan Fedorovitch himself was received everywhere with respect. He deserved this, partly on account of his wealth and position, partly because, though limited, he was really a very good fellow. But a certain limitation of mind seems to be an indispensable asset, if not to all public personages, at least to all serious financiers. Added to this, his manner was modest and unassuming; he knew when to be silent, yet never allowed himself to be trampled upon. Also\u2014and this was more important than all\u2014he had the advantage of being under exalted patronage.",
            "As to Lizabetha Prokofievna, she, as the reader knows, belonged to an aristocratic family. True, Russians think more of influential friends than of birth, but she had both. She was esteemed and even loved by people of consequence in society, whose example in receiving her was therefore followed by others. It seems hardly necessary to remark that her family worries and anxieties had little or no foundation, or that her imagination increased them to an absurd degree; but if you have a wart on your forehead or nose, you imagine that all the world is looking at it, and that people would make fun of you because of it, even if you had discovered America! Doubtless Lizabetha Prokofievna was considered \u201ceccentric\u201d in society, but she was none the less esteemed: the pity was that she was ceasing to believe in that esteem. When she thought of her daughters, she said to herself sorrowfully that she was a hindrance rather than a help to their future, that her character and temper were absurd, ridiculous, insupportable. Naturally, she put the blame on her surroundings, and from morning to night was quarrelling with her husband and children, whom she really loved to the point of self-sacrifice, even, one might say, of passion.",
            "She was, above all distressed by the idea that her daughters might grow up \u201ceccentric,\u201d like herself; she believed that no other society girls were like them. \u201cThey are growing into Nihilists!\u201d she repeated over and over again. For years she had tormented herself with this idea, and with the question: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they get married?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is to annoy their mother; that is their one aim in life; it can be nothing else. The fact is it is all of a piece with these modern ideas, that wretched woman\u2019s question! Six months ago Aglaya took a fancy to cut off her magnificent hair. Why, even I, when I was young, had nothing like it! The scissors were in her hand, and I had to go down on my knees and implore her... She did it, I know, from sheer mischief, to spite her mother, for she is a naughty, capricious girl, a real spoiled child spiteful and mischievous to a degree! And then Alexandra wanted to shave her head, not from caprice or mischief, but, like a little fool, simply because Aglaya persuaded her she would sleep better without her hair, and not suffer from headache! And how many suitors have they not had during the last five years! Excellent offers, too! What more do they want? Why don\u2019t they get married? For no other reason than to vex their mother\u2014none\u2014none!\u201d",
            "But Lizabetha Prokofievna felt somewhat consoled when she could say that one of her girls, Adelaida, was settled at last. \u201cIt will be one off our hands!\u201d she declared aloud, though in private she expressed herself with greater tenderness. The engagement was both happy and suitable, and was therefore approved in society. Prince S. was a distinguished man, he had money, and his future wife was devoted to him; what more could be desired? Lizabetha Prokofievna had felt less anxious about this daughter, however, although she considered her artistic tastes suspicious. But to make up for them she was, as her mother expressed it, \u201cmerry,\u201d and had plenty of \u201ccommon-sense.\u201d It was Aglaya\u2019s future which disturbed her most. With regard to her eldest daughter, Alexandra, the mother never quite knew whether there was cause for anxiety or not. Sometimes she felt as if there was nothing to be expected from her. She was twenty-five now, and must be fated to be an old maid, and \u201cwith such beauty, too!\u201d The mother spent whole nights in weeping and lamenting, while all the time the cause of her grief slumbered peacefully. \u201cWhat is the matter with her? Is she a Nihilist, or simply a fool?\u201d",
            "But Lizabetha Prokofievna knew perfectly well how unnecessary was the last question. She set a high value on Alexandra Ivanovna\u2019s judgment, and often consulted her in difficulties; but that she was a \u2018wet hen\u2019 she never for a moment doubted. \u201cShe is so calm; nothing rouses her\u2014though wet hens are not always calm! Oh! I can\u2019t understand it!\u201d Her eldest daughter inspired Lizabetha with a kind of puzzled compassion. She did not feel this in Aglaya\u2019s case, though the latter was her idol. It may be said that these outbursts and epithets, such as \u201cwet hen\u201d (in which the maternal solicitude usually showed itself), only made Alexandra laugh. Sometimes the most trivial thing annoyed Mrs. Epanchin, and drove her into a frenzy. For instance, Alexandra Ivanovna liked to sleep late, and was always dreaming, though her dreams had the peculiarity of being as innocent and naive as those of a child of seven; and the very innocence of her dreams annoyed her mother. Once she dreamt of nine hens, and this was the cause of quite a serious quarrel\u2014no one knew why. Another time she had\u2014it was most unusual\u2014a dream with a spark of originality in it. She dreamt of a monk in a dark room, into which she was too frightened to go. Adelaida and Aglaya rushed off with shrieks of laughter to relate this to their mother, but she was quite angry, and said her daughters were all fools.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! she is as stupid as a fool! A veritable \u2018wet hen\u2019! Nothing excites her; and yet she is not happy; some days it makes one miserable only to look at her! Why is she unhappy, I wonder?\u201d At times Lizabetha Prokofievna put this question to her husband, and as usual she spoke in the threatening tone of one who demands an immediate answer. Ivan Fedorovitch would frown, shrug his shoulders, and at last give his opinion: \u201cShe needs a husband!\u201d",
            "\u201cGod forbid that he should share your ideas, Ivan Fedorovitch!\u201d his wife flashed back. \u201cOr that he should be as gross and churlish as you!\u201d",
            "The general promptly made his escape, and Lizabetha Prokofievna after a while grew calm again. That evening, of course, she would be unusually attentive, gentle, and respectful to her \u201cgross and churlish\u201d husband, her \u201cdear, kind Ivan Fedorovitch,\u201d for she had never left off loving him. She was even still \u201cin love\u201d with him. He knew it well, and for his part held her in the greatest esteem.",
            "But the mother\u2019s great and continual anxiety was Aglaya. \u201cShe is exactly like me\u2014my image in everything,\u201d said Mrs. Epanchin to herself. \u201cA tyrant! A real little demon! A Nihilist! Eccentric, senseless and mischievous! Good Lord, how unhappy she will be!\u201d",
            "But as we said before, the fact of Adelaida\u2019s approaching marriage was balm to the mother. For a whole month she forgot her fears and worries.",
            "Adelaida\u2019s fate was settled; and with her name that of Aglaya\u2019s was linked, in society gossip. People whispered that Aglaya, too, was \u201cas good as engaged;\u201d and Aglaya always looked so sweet and behaved so well (during this period), that the mother\u2019s heart was full of joy. Of course, Evgenie Pavlovitch must be thoroughly studied first, before the final step should be taken; but, really, how lovely dear Aglaya had become\u2014she actually grew more beautiful every day! And then\u2014Yes, and then\u2014this abominable prince showed his face again, and everything went topsy-turvy at once, and everyone seemed as mad as March hares.",
            "What had really happened?",
            "If it had been any other family than the Epanchins\u2019, nothing particular would have happened. But, thanks to Mrs. Epanchin\u2019s invariable fussiness and anxiety, there could not be the slightest hitch in the simplest matters of everyday life, but she immediately foresaw the most dreadful and alarming consequences, and suffered accordingly.",
            "What then must have been her condition, when, among all the imaginary anxieties and calamities which so constantly beset her, she now saw looming ahead a serious cause for annoyance\u2014something really likely to arouse doubts and suspicions!",
            "\u201cHow dared they, how _dared_ they write that hateful anonymous letter informing me that Aglaya is in communication with Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d she thought, as she dragged the prince along towards her own house, and again when she sat him down at the round table where the family was already assembled. \u201cHow dared they so much as _think_ of such a thing? I should _die_ with shame if I thought there was a particle of truth in it, or if I were to show the letter to Aglaya herself! Who dares play these jokes upon _us_, the Epanchins? _Why_ didn\u2019t we go to the Yelagin instead of coming down here? I _told_ you we had better go to the Yelagin this summer, Ivan Fedorovitch. It\u2019s all your fault. I dare say it was that Varia who sent the letter. It\u2019s all Ivan Fedorovitch. _That_ woman is doing it all for him, I know she is, to show she can make a fool of him now just as she did when he used to give her pearls.",
            "\u201cBut after all is said, we are mixed up in it. Your daughters are mixed up in it, Ivan Fedorovitch; young ladies in society, young ladies at an age to be married; they were present, they heard everything there was to hear. They were mixed up with that other scene, too, with those dreadful youths. You must be pleased to remember they heard it all. I cannot forgive that wretched prince. I never shall forgive him! And why, if you please, has Aglaya had an attack of nerves for these last three days? Why has she all but quarrelled with her sisters, even with Alexandra\u2014whom she respects so much that she always kisses her hands as though she were her mother? What are all these riddles of hers that we have to guess? What has Gavrila Ardalionovitch to do with it? Why did she take upon herself to champion him this morning, and burst into tears over it? Why is there an allusion to that cursed \u2018poor knight\u2019 in the anonymous letter? And why did I rush off to him just now like a lunatic, and drag him back here? I do believe I\u2019ve gone mad at last. What on earth have I done now? To talk to a young man about my daughter\u2019s secrets\u2014and secrets having to do with himself, too! Thank goodness, he\u2019s an idiot, and a friend of the house! Surely Aglaya hasn\u2019t fallen in love with such a gaby! What an idea! Pfu! we ought all to be put under glass cases\u2014myself first of all\u2014and be shown off as curiosities, at ten copecks a peep!\u201d",
            "\u201cI shall never forgive you for all this, Ivan Fedorovitch\u2014never! Look at her now. Why doesn\u2019t she make fun of him? She said she would, and she doesn\u2019t. Look there! She stares at him with all her eyes, and doesn\u2019t move; and yet she told him not to come. He looks pale enough; and that abominable chatterbox, Evgenie Pavlovitch, monopolizes the whole of the conversation. Nobody else can get a word in. I could soon find out all about everything if I could only change the subject.\u201d",
            "The prince certainly was very pale. He sat at the table and seemed to be feeling, by turns, sensations of alarm and rapture.",
            "Oh, how frightened he was of looking to one side\u2014one particular corner\u2014whence he knew very well that a pair of dark eyes were watching him intently, and how happy he was to think that he was once more among them, and occasionally hearing that well-known voice, although she had written and forbidden him to come again!",
            "\u201cWhat on earth will she say to me, I wonder?\u201d he thought to himself.",
            "He had not said a word yet; he sat silent and listened to Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s eloquence. The latter had never appeared so happy and excited as on this evening. The prince listened to him, but for a long time did not take in a word he said.",
            "Excepting Ivan Fedorovitch, who had not as yet returned from town, the whole family was present. Prince S. was there; and they all intended to go out to hear the band very soon.",
            "Colia arrived presently and joined the circle. \u201cSo he is received as usual, after all,\u201d thought the prince.",
            "The Epanchins\u2019 country-house was a charming building, built after the model of a Swiss chalet, and covered with creepers. It was surrounded on all sides by a flower garden, and the family sat, as a rule, on the open verandah as at the prince\u2019s house.",
            "The subject under discussion did not appear to be very popular with the assembly, and some would have been delighted to change it; but Evgenie would not stop holding forth, and the prince\u2019s arrival seemed to spur him on to still further oratorical efforts.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna frowned, but had not as yet grasped the subject, which seemed to have arisen out of a heated argument. Aglaya sat apart, almost in the corner, listening in stubborn silence.",
            "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d continued Evgenie Pavlovitch hotly, \u201cI don\u2019t say a word against liberalism. Liberalism is not a sin, it is a necessary part of a great whole, which whole would collapse and fall to pieces without it. Liberalism has just as much right to exist as has the most moral conservatism; but I am attacking _Russian_ liberalism; and I attack it for the simple reason that a Russian liberal is not a Russian liberal, he is a non-Russian liberal. Show me a real Russian liberal, and I\u2019ll kiss him before you all, with pleasure.\u201d",
            "\u201cIf he cared to kiss you, that is,\u201d said Alexandra, whose cheeks were red with irritation and excitement.",
            "\u201cLook at that, now,\u201d thought the mother to herself, \u201cshe does nothing but sleep and eat for a year at a time, and then suddenly flies out in the most incomprehensible way!\u201d",
            "The prince observed that Alexandra appeared to be angry with Evgenie, because he spoke on a serious subject in a frivolous manner, pretending to be in earnest, but with an under-current of irony.",
            "\u201cI was saying just now, before you came in, prince, that there has been nothing national up to now, about our liberalism, and nothing the liberals do, or have done, is in the least degree national. They are drawn from two classes only, the old landowning class, and clerical families\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cHow, nothing that they have done is Russian?\u201d asked Prince S.",
            "\u201cIt may be Russian, but it is not national. Our liberals are not Russian, nor are our conservatives, and you may be sure that the nation does not recognize anything that has been done by the landed gentry, or by the seminarists, or what is to be done either.\u201d",
            "\u201cCome, that\u2019s good! How can you maintain such a paradox? If you are serious, that is. I cannot allow such a statement about the landed proprietors to pass unchallenged. Why, you are a landed proprietor yourself!\u201d cried Prince S. hotly.",
            "\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll say there is nothing national about our literature either?\u201d said Alexandra.",
            "\u201cWell, I am not a great authority on literary questions, but I certainly do hold that Russian literature is not Russian, except perhaps Lomonosoff, Pouschkin and Gogol.\u201d",
            "\u201cIn the first place, that is a considerable admission, and in the second place, one of the above was a peasant, and the other two were both landed proprietors!\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so, but don\u2019t be in such a hurry! For since it has been the part of these three men, and only these three, to say something absolutely their own, not borrowed, so by this very fact these three men become really national. If any Russian shall have done or said anything really and absolutely original, he is to be called national from that moment, though he may not be able to talk the Russian language; still he is a national Russian. I consider that an axiom. But we were not speaking of literature; we began by discussing the socialists. Very well then, I insist that there does not exist one single Russian socialist. There does not, and there has never existed such a one, because all socialists are derived from the two classes\u2014the landed proprietors, and the seminarists. All our eminent socialists are merely old liberals of the class of landed proprietors, men who were liberals in the days of serfdom. Why do you laugh? Give me their books, give me their studies, their memoirs, and though I am not a literary critic, yet I will prove as clear as day that every chapter and every word of their writings has been the work of a former landed proprietor of the old school. You\u2019ll find that all their raptures, all their generous transports are proprietary, all their woes and their tears, proprietary; all proprietary or seminarist! You are laughing again, and you, prince, are smiling too. Don\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d",
            "It was true enough that everybody was laughing, the prince among them.",
            "\u201cI cannot tell you on the instant whether I agree with you or not,\u201d said the latter, suddenly stopping his laughter, and starting like a schoolboy caught at mischief. \u201cBut, I assure you, I am listening to you with extreme gratification.\u201d",
            "So saying, he almost panted with agitation, and a cold sweat stood upon his forehead. These were his first words since he had entered the house; he tried to lift his eyes, and look around, but dared not; Evgenie Pavlovitch noticed his confusion, and smiled.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll just tell you one fact, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d continued the latter, with apparent seriousness and even exaltation of manner, but with a suggestion of \u201cchaff\u201d behind every word, as though he were laughing in his sleeve at his own nonsense\u2014\u201ca fact, the discovery of which, I believe, I may claim to have made by myself alone. At all events, no other has ever said or written a word about it; and in this fact is expressed the whole essence of Russian liberalism of the sort which I am now considering.",
            "\u201cIn the first place, what is liberalism, speaking generally, but an attack (whether mistaken or reasonable, is quite another question) upon the existing order of things? Is this so? Yes. Very well. Then my \u2018fact\u2019 consists in this, that _Russian_ liberalism is not an attack upon the existing order of things, but an attack upon the very essence of things themselves\u2014indeed, on the things themselves; not an attack on the Russian order of things, but on Russia itself. My Russian liberal goes so far as to reject Russia; that is, he hates and strikes his own mother. Every misfortune and mishap of the mother-country fills him with mirth, and even with ecstasy. He hates the national customs, Russian history, and everything. If he has a justification, it is that he does not know what he is doing, and believes that his hatred of Russia is the grandest and most profitable kind of liberalism. (You will often find a liberal who is applauded and esteemed by his fellows, but who is in reality the dreariest, blindest, dullest of conservatives, and is not aware of the fact.) This hatred for Russia has been mistaken by some of our \u2018Russian liberals\u2019 for sincere love of their country, and they boast that they see better than their neighbours what real love of one\u2019s country should consist in. But of late they have grown, more candid and are ashamed of the expression \u2018love of country,\u2019 and have annihilated the very spirit of the words as something injurious and petty and undignified. This is the truth, and I hold by it; but at the same time it is a phenomenon which has not been repeated at any other time or place; and therefore, though I hold to it as a fact, yet I recognize that it is an accidental phenomenon, and may likely enough pass away. There can be no such thing anywhere else as a liberal who really hates his country; and how is this fact to be explained among _us?_ By my original statement that a Russian liberal is _not_ a _Russian_ liberal\u2014that\u2019s the only explanation that I can see.\u201d",
            "\u201cI take all that you have said as a joke,\u201d said Prince S. seriously.",
            "\u201cI have not seen all kinds of liberals, and cannot, therefore, set myself up as a judge,\u201d said Alexandra, \u201cbut I have heard all you have said with indignation. You have taken some accidental case and twisted it into a universal law, which is unjust.\u201d",
            "\u201cAccidental case!\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch. \u201cDo you consider it an accidental case, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cI must also admit,\u201d said the prince, \u201cthat I have not seen much, or been very far into the question; but I cannot help thinking that you are more or less right, and that Russian liberalism\u2014that phase of it which you are considering, at least\u2014really is sometimes inclined to hate Russia itself, and not only its existing order of things in general. Of course this is only _partially_ the truth; you cannot lay down the law for all...\u201d",
            "The prince blushed and broke off, without finishing what he meant to say.",
            "In spite of his shyness and agitation, he could not help being greatly interested in the conversation. A special characteristic of his was the naive candour with which he always listened to arguments which interested him, and with which he answered any questions put to him on the subject at issue. In the very expression of his face this naivete was unmistakably evident, this disbelief in the insincerity of others, and unsuspecting disregard of irony or humour in their words.",
            "But though Evgenie Pavlovitch had put his questions to the prince with no other purpose but to enjoy the joke of his simple-minded seriousness, yet now, at his answer, he was surprised into some seriousness himself, and looked gravely at Muishkin as though he had not expected that sort of answer at all.",
            "\u201cWhy, how strange!\u201d he ejaculated. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me seriously, surely, did you?\u201d",
            "\u201cDid not you ask me the question seriously\u201d inquired the prince, in amazement.",
            "Everybody laughed.",
            "\u201cOh, trust _him_ for that!\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cEvgenie Pavlovitch turns everything and everybody he can lay hold of to ridicule. You should hear the things he says sometimes, apparently in perfect seriousness.\u201d",
            "\u201cIn my opinion the conversation has been a painful one throughout, and we ought never to have begun it,\u201d said Alexandra. \u201cWe were all going for a walk\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cCome along then,\u201d said Evgenie; \u201cit\u2019s a glorious evening. But, to prove that this time I was speaking absolutely seriously, and especially to prove this to the prince (for you, prince, have interested me exceedingly, and I swear to you that I am not quite such an ass as I like to appear sometimes, although I am rather an ass, I admit), and\u2014well, ladies and gentlemen, will you allow me to put just one more question to the prince, out of pure curiosity? It shall be the last. This question came into my mind a couple of hours since (you see, prince, I do think seriously at times), and I made my own decision upon it; now I wish to hear what the prince will say to it.\u201d",
            "\u201cWe have just used the expression \u2018accidental case.\u2019 This is a significant phrase; we often hear it. Well, not long since everyone was talking and reading about that terrible murder of six people on the part of a\u2014young fellow, and of the extraordinary speech of the counsel for the defence, who observed that in the poverty-stricken condition of the criminal it must have come _naturally_ into his head to kill these six people. I do not quote his words, but that is the sense of them, or something very like it. Now, in my opinion, the barrister who put forward this extraordinary plea was probably absolutely convinced that he was stating the most liberal, the most humane, the most enlightened view of the case that could possibly be brought forward in these days. Now, was this distortion, this capacity for a perverted way of viewing things, a special or accidental case, or is such a general rule?\u201d",

            "\u201cWhat do you think about it, prince?\u201d asked Evgenie, taking no notice of the last remark, and observing Muishkin\u2019s serious eyes fixed upon his face. \u201cWhat do you think\u2014was it a special or a usual case\u2014the rule, or an exception? I confess I put the question especially for you.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it was a special case,\u201d said the prince, quietly, but firmly.",
            "\u201cMy dear fellow!\u201d cried Prince S., with some annoyance, \u201cdon\u2019t you see that he is chaffing you? He is simply laughing at you, and wants to make game of you.\u201d",

            "\u201cMy dear prince,\u201d continued Prince S. \u201cremember what you and I were saying two or three months ago. We spoke of the fact that in our newly opened Law Courts one could already lay one\u2019s finger upon so many talented and remarkable young barristers. How pleased you were with the state of things as we found it, and how glad I was to observe your delight! We both said it was a matter to be proud of; but this clumsy defence that Evgenie mentions, this strange argument _can_, of course, only be an accidental case\u2014one in a thousand!\u201d",
            "The prince reflected a little, but very soon he replied, with absolute conviction in his tone, though he still spoke somewhat shyly and timidly:",
            "\u201cI only wished to say that this \u2018distortion,\u2019 as Evgenie Pavlovitch expressed it, is met with very often, and is far more the general rule than the exception, unfortunately for Russia. So much so, that if this distortion were not the general rule, perhaps these dreadful crimes would be less frequent.\u201d",
            "\u201cDreadful crimes? But I can assure you that crimes just as dreadful, and probably more horrible, have occurred before our times, and at all times, and not only here in Russia, but everywhere else as well. And in my opinion it is not at all likely that such murders will cease to occur for a very long time to come. The only difference is that in former times there was less publicity, while now everyone talks and writes freely about such things\u2014which fact gives the impression that such crimes have only now sprung into existence. That is where your mistake lies\u2014an extremely natural mistake, I assure you, my dear fellow!\u201d said Prince S.",
            "\u201cI know that there were just as many, and just as terrible, crimes before our times. Not long since I visited a convict prison and made acquaintance with some of the criminals. There were some even more dreadful criminals than this one we have been speaking of\u2014men who have murdered a dozen of their fellow-creatures, and feel no remorse whatever. But what I especially noticed was this, that the very most hopeless and remorseless murderer\u2014however hardened a criminal he may be\u2014still _knows that he is a criminal_; that is, he is conscious that he has acted wickedly, though he may feel no remorse whatever. And they were all like this. Those of whom Evgenie Pavlovitch has spoken, do not admit that they are criminals at all; they think they had a right to do what they did, and that they were even doing a good deed, perhaps. I consider there is the greatest difference between the two cases. And recollect\u2014it was a _youth_, at the particular age which is most helplessly susceptible to the distortion of ideas!\u201d",

            "\u201cNo! Oh no! Not at all!\u201d said Evgenie. \u201cBut\u2014how is it, prince, that you\u2014(excuse the question, will you?)\u2014if you are capable of observing and seeing things as you evidently do, how is it that you saw nothing distorted or perverted in that claim upon your property, which you acknowledged a day or two since; and which was full of arguments founded upon the most distorted views of right and wrong?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, my friend,\u201d cried Mrs. Epanchin, of a sudden, \u201chere are we all sitting here and imagining we are very clever, and perhaps laughing at the prince, some of us, and meanwhile he has received a letter this very day in which that same claimant renounces his claim, and begs the prince\u2019s pardon. There! _we_ don\u2019t often get that sort of letter; and yet we are not ashamed to walk with our noses in the air before him.\u201d",

You did go up to town, you know you did\u2014you said so yourself! Now then, did you, or did you not, go down on your knees and beg him to come, confess!\u201d",

He is very happy to be here; but I think perhaps it would be better if you let him alone for today,\u2014he is very sensitive now that he is so ill\u2014and he might be embarrassed if you show him too much attention at first. He is decidedly better today, and says he has not felt so well for the last six months, and has coughed much less, too.\u201d",

But I see that I am out of place in society\u2014society is better without me. It\u2019s not vanity, I assure you. I have thought over it all these last three days, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself candidly before you at the first opportunity. There are certain things, certain great ideas, which I must not so much as approach, as Prince S. has just reminded me, or I shall make you all laugh. I have no sense of proportion, I know; my words and gestures do not express my ideas\u2014they are a humiliation and abasement of the ideas, and therefore, I have no right\u2014and I am too sensitive. Still, I believe I am beloved in this household, and esteemed far more than I deserve. But I can\u2019t help knowing that after twenty-four years of illness there must be some trace left, so that it is impossible for people to refrain from laughing at me sometimes; don\u2019t you think so?\u201d",

You are more honest than all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all. There are some here who are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have just dropped.

Why have they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince? I will not marry you\u2014never, and under no circumstances! Know that once and for all; as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you! Just look in the glass and see what you look like, this very moment!

I assure you I am not guilty, Aglaya Ivanovna, I am not, indeed. I never did wish to\u2014I never thought of it at all\u2014and never shall\u2014you\u2019ll see it yourself\u2014you may be quite assured of it.

She, too, glanced at the prince\u2019s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a fit of laughter as Aglaya\u2019s own. They laughed together like a couple of school-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed \u201cWell, thank God\u2014thank God!\u201d",

You needn\u2019t go away, you dear good fellow! _Isn\u2019t_ he a dear, Aglaya? Isn\u2019t he, mother? I must really give him a kiss for\u2014for his explanation to Aglaya just now. Mother, dear, I may kiss him, mayn\u2019t I? Aglaya, may I kiss _your_ prince?\u201d cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up to the prince and kissed his forehead.",
            "He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly cried out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her right hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.",
            "\u201cCome along,\u201d said Aglaya. \u201cPrince, you must walk with me. May he, mother? This young cavalier, who won\u2019t have me? You said you would _never_ have me, didn\u2019t you, prince? No\u2014no, not like that; _that\u2019s_ not the way to give your arm. Don\u2019t you know how to give your arm to a lady yet? There\u2014so. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would you like to lead the way with me alone, t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate?\u201d",

            "\u201cThank God\u2014thank God!\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself, without quite knowing why she felt so relieved.",
            "\u201cWhat extraordinary people they are!\u201d thought Prince S., for perhaps the hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with the family; but\u2014he liked these \u201cextraordinary people,\u201d all the same. As for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to like him, somehow. He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed as they all started off.",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. He made Adelaida and Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed so very readily and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to suspect that they were not listening to him at all.",
            "At this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected mirth, and without giving any explanation.",
            "The sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of glancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. It was evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.",
            "Prince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. She was absent-minded to a degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.",
            "But the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening. The last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. When they had proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her obstinately silent cavalier in a quick half-whisper:",
            "\u201cLook to the right!\u201d",
            "The prince glanced in the direction indicated.",
            "\u201cLook closer. Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those three big trees\u2014that green bench?\u201d",
            "The prince replied that he saw it.",
            "\u201cDo you like the position of it? Sometimes of a morning early, at seven o\u2019clock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there alone.\u201d",
            "The prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one.",
            "\u201cNow, go away, I don\u2019t wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps, better, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but don\u2019t speak a word to me. I wish to think by myself.\u201d",
            "The warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have said a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not. His heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could she\u2014but no! he banished the thought, after an instant\u2019s deliberation.",
            "At Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on Sundays and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and enjoy the park.",
            "The ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to gather round the band, which is probably the best of our pleasure-garden bands, and plays the newest pieces. The behaviour of the public is most correct and proper, and there is an appearance of friendly intimacy among the usual frequenters. Many come for nothing but to look at their acquaintances, but there are others who come for the sake of the music. It is very seldom that anything happens to break the harmony of the proceedings, though, of course, accidents will happen everywhere.",
            "On this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were a large number of people present. All the places anywhere near the orchestra were occupied.",
            "Our friends took chairs near the side exit. The crowd and the music cheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and shook hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to others; they examined the ladies\u2019 dresses, noticed comicalities and eccentricities among the people, and laughed and talked among themselves. Evgenie Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to. Several people noticed Aglaya and the prince, who were still together.",
            "Before very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two remained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate terms with Evgenie Pavlovitch. Among them was a young officer, a remarkably handsome fellow\u2014very good-natured and a great chatterbox. He tried to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure her attention. Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted and laughed merrily. Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the prince\u2019s leave to introduce their friend to him. The prince hardly realized what was wanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and shook hands.",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s friend asked the prince some question, but the latter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely indistinct that there was nothing to be made of it. The officer stared intently at him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had introduced him, and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again. Only Evgenie Pavlovitch observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at this.",
            "The prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot that he was sitting by her himself. At other moments he felt a longing to go away somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that no one knew where he was.",
            "Or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the terrace\u2014without either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about him, and to lie there and think\u2014a day and night and another day again! He thought of the mountains\u2014and especially of a certain spot which he used to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys and fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver thread, and the old ruined castle in the distance. Oh! how he longed to be there now\u2014alone with his thoughts\u2014to think of one thing all his life\u2014one thing! A thousand years would not be too much time! And let everyone here forget him\u2014forget him utterly! How much better it would have been if they had never known him\u2014if all this could but prove to be a dream. Perhaps it was a dream!",
            "Now and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without taking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange; he would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles distant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself at all.",
            "\u201cWhy do you look at me like that, prince?\u201d she asked suddenly, breaking off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of you! You look as though you were just going to put out your hand and touch my face to see if it\u2019s real! Doesn\u2019t he, Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2014doesn\u2019t he look like that?\u201d",
            "The prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all; he reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said to him; at all events, he did not answer. But observing that she and the others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with them.",
            "The laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.",
            "Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the word\u2014",
            "\u201cIdiot!\u201d",
            "\u201cMy goodness\u2014surely she is not in love with such a\u2014surely she isn\u2019t mad!\u201d groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s all a joke, mamma; it\u2019s just a joke like the \u2018poor knight\u2019\u2014nothing more whatever, I assure you!\u201d Alexandra whispered in her ear. \u201cShe is chaffing him\u2014making a fool of him, after her own private fashion, that\u2019s all! But she carries it just a little too far\u2014she is a regular little actress. How she frightened us just now\u2014didn\u2019t she?\u2014and all for a lark!\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, it\u2019s lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, that\u2019s all I can say!\u201d whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted, however, by her daughter\u2019s remark.",
            "The prince had heard himself referred to as \u201cidiot,\u201d and had shuddered at the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the word applied to him. The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where he was sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a well-known smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a moment, and disappeared again. Very likely he had imagined it! There only remained to him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and a bright green tie. Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or whether he had turned towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say.",
            "But a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him. That first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second; it was almost certain to be so. Surely he had not forgotten the possibility of such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall? True enough, he had not remarked where he was coming to when he set out with Aglaya; he had not been in a condition to remark anything at all.",
            "Had he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen that for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing around in apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or something particular, among the crowd of people. Now, at the moment when his own anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased visibly, and when he looked about him, she did the same.",
            "The reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. From that very side entrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin party were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of persons, at least a dozen.",
            "Heading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were remarkably lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that they should have had a large troop of admirers following in their wake.",
            "But there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their admirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of the public assembled around the orchestra.",
            "Nearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended not to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged glances and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers.",
            "It was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they made their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking loudly. It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half drunk, although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well. There were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking creatures, with flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were military men; not all were quite young; one or two were middle-aged gentlemen of decidedly disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in society like the plague, decked out in large gold studs and rings, and magnificently \u201cgot up,\u201d generally.",
            "Among our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially high reputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful individual is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling suddenly upon his head from his neighbour\u2019s roof.",
            "Such a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public now assembled to hear the music.",
            "In order to pass from the Vauxhall to the band-stand, the visitor has to descend two or three steps. Just at these steps the group paused, as though it feared to proceed further; but very quickly one of the three ladies, who formed its apex, stepped forward into the charmed circle, followed by two members of her suite.",
            "One of these was a middle-aged man of very respectable appearance, but with the stamp of parvenu upon him, a man whom nobody knew, and who evidently knew nobody. The other follower was younger and far less respectable-looking.",
            "No one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps she did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same to her whether anyone were following or not. She laughed and talked loudly, however, just as before. She was dressed with great taste, but with rather more magnificence than was needed for the occasion, perhaps.",
            "She walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting, near the road.",
            "The prince had not seen _her_ for more than three months. All these days since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a visit, but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him. He could not picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make upon him, though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and trembling. One fact was quite certain, and that was that the meeting would be painful.",
            "Several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect which the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw its portrait. He recollected well that even the portrait face had left but too painful an impression.",
            "That month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every day, had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon it calmly. In the very look of this woman there was something which tortured him. In conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this sensation to pity\u2014immeasurable pity, and this was the truth. The sight of the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of real sympathy; and this feeling of sympathy, nay, of actual _suffering_, for her, had never left his heart since that hour, and was still in full force. Oh yes, and more powerful than ever!",
            "But the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin. Only at this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did he realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him, and which he had not described correctly to Rogojin.",
            "And, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his horror, yes, _horror_, for he was now fully convinced from his own private knowledge of her, that the woman was mad.",
            "If, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a foretaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to behold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one would feel something like what the poor prince now felt.",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a little tug.",
            "He turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some reason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting her in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to watch the startling apparition before him.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladies\u2019 chairs.",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and interesting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much animation. The prince remembered that at this moment Aglaya remarked in a half-whisper:",
            "\u201c_What_ a\u2014\u201d",
            "She did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a moment; but it was enough.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she had not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their direction, as though she had just observed Evgenie Pavlovitch sitting there for the first time.",
            "\u201cWhy, I declare, here he is!\u201d she cried, stopping suddenly. \u201cThe man one can\u2019t find with all one\u2019s messengers sent about the place, sitting just under one\u2019s nose, exactly where one never thought of looking! I thought you were sure to be at your uncle\u2019s by this time.\u201d",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia Philipovna, then turned his back on her.",
            "\u201cWhat! don\u2019t you know about it yet? He doesn\u2019t know\u2014imagine that! Why, he\u2019s shot himself. Your uncle shot himself this very morning. I was told at two this afternoon. Half the town must know it by now. They say there are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles, government money, missing; some say five hundred thousand. And I was under the impression that he would leave you a fortune! He\u2019s whistled it all away. A most depraved old gentleman, really! Well, ta, ta!\u2014bonne chance! Surely you intend to be off there, don\u2019t you? Ha, ha! You\u2019ve retired from the army in good time, I see! Plain clothes! Well done, sly rogue! Nonsense! I see\u2014you knew it all before\u2014I dare say you knew all about it yesterday-\u201d",
            "Although the impudence of this attack, this public proclamation of intimacy, as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special object, yet Evgenie Pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no show of observing either his tormentor or her words. But Nastasia\u2019s communication struck him with the force of a thunderclap. On hearing of his uncle\u2019s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned towards his informant.",
            "At this moment, Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat, beckoned her companions, and left the place almost at a run.",
            "Only the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision; and Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his scattered wits. But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than twenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred. The young officer, Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s friend who had been conversing with Aglaya, said aloud in a great state of indignation:",
            "\u201cShe ought to be whipped\u2014that\u2019s the only way to deal with creatures like that\u2014she ought to be whipped!\u201d",
            "This gentleman was a confidant of Evgenie\u2019s, and had doubtless heard of the carriage episode.",
            "Nastasia turned to him. Her eyes flashed; she rushed up to a young man standing near, whom she did not know in the least, but who happened to have in his hand a thin cane. Seizing this from him, she brought it with all her force across the face of her insulter.",
            "All this occurred, of course, in one instant of time.",
            "The young officer, forgetting himself, sprang towards her. Nastasia\u2019s followers were not by her at the moment (the elderly gentleman having disappeared altogether, and the younger man simply standing aside and roaring with laughter).",
            "In another moment, of course, the police would have been on the spot, and it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected aid appeared.",
            "Muishkin, who was but a couple of steps away, had time to spring forward and seize the officer\u2019s arms from behind.",
            "The officer, tearing himself from the prince\u2019s grasp, pushed him so violently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided into a chair.",
            "But there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time. The gentleman known as the \u201cboxer\u201d now confronted the enraged officer.",
            "\u201cKeller is my name, sir; ex-lieutenant,\u201d he said, very loud. \u201cIf you will accept me as champion of the fair sex, I am at your disposal. English boxing has no secrets from me. I sympathize with you for the insult you have received, but I can\u2019t permit you to raise your hand against a woman in public. If you prefer to meet me\u2014as would be more fitting to your rank\u2014in some other manner, of course you understand me, captain.\u201d",
            "But the young officer had recovered himself, and was no longer listening. At this moment Rogojin appeared, elbowing through the crowd; he took Nastasia\u2019s hand, drew it through his arm, and quickly led her away. He appeared to be terribly excited; he was trembling all over, and was as pale as a corpse. As he carried Nastasia off, he turned and grinned horribly in the officer\u2019s face, and with low malice observed:",
            "\u201cTfu! look what the fellow got! Look at the blood on his cheek! Ha, ha!\u201d",
            "Recollecting himself, however, and seeing at a glance the sort of people he had to deal with, the officer turned his back on both his opponents, and courteously, but concealing his face with his handkerchief, approached the prince, who was now rising from the chair into which he had fallen.",
            "\u201cPrince Muishkin, I believe? The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?\u201d",
            "\u201cShe is mad, insane\u2014I assure you, she is mad,\u201d replied the prince in trembling tones, holding out both his hands mechanically towards the officer.",
            "\u201cI cannot boast of any such knowledge, of course, but I wished to know your name.\u201d",
            "He bowed and retired without waiting for an answer.",
            "Five seconds after the disappearance of the last actor in this scene, the police arrived. The whole episode had not lasted more than a couple of minutes. Some of the spectators had risen from their places, and departed altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a little further off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked and laughed over it for a long time.",
            "In a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began to play again. The prince walked away after the Epanchin party. Had he thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing some twenty yards away. She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in spite of her mother\u2019s and sisters\u2019 anxious cries to her to come away.",
            "Prince S. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with them.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of agitation that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls. But only a couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park, Aglaya suddenly remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:",
            "\u201cI wanted to see how the farce would end.\u201d "
        ],
        "III.": [
            "In her opinion there was so much disclosed and laid bare by the episode, that, in spite of the chaotic condition of her mind, she was able to feel more or less decided on certain points which, up to now, had been in a cloudy condition.",
            "However, one and all of the party realized that something important had happened, and that, perhaps fortunately enough, something which had hitherto been enveloped in the obscurity of guess-work had now begun to come forth a little from the mists. In spite of Prince S.\u2018s assurances and explanations, Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s real character and position were at last coming to light. He was publicly convicted of intimacy with \u201cthat creature.\u201d So thought Lizabetha Prokofievna and her two elder daughters.",
            "But the real upshot of the business was that the number of riddles to be solved was augmented. The two girls, though rather irritated at their mother\u2019s exaggerated alarm and haste to depart from the scene, had been unwilling to worry her at first with questions.",
            "Besides, they could not help thinking that their sister Aglaya probably knew more about the whole matter than both they and their mother put together.",
            "Prince S. looked as black as night, and was silent and moody. Mrs. Epanchin did not say a word to him all the way home, and he did not seem to observe the fact. Adelaida tried to pump him a little by asking, \u201cwho was the uncle they were talking about, and what was it that had happened in Petersburg?\u201d But he had merely muttered something disconnected about \u201cmaking inquiries,\u201d and that \u201cof course it was all nonsense.\u201d \u201cOh, of course,\u201d replied Adelaida, and asked no more questions. Aglaya, too, was very quiet; and the only remark she made on the way home was that they were \u201cwalking much too fast to be pleasant.\u201d",
            "Once she turned and observed the prince hurrying after them. Noticing his anxiety to catch them up, she smiled ironically, and then looked back no more. At length, just as they neared the house, General Epanchin came out and met them; he had only just arrived from town.",
            "His first word was to inquire after Evgenie Pavlovitch. But Lizabetha stalked past him, and neither looked at him nor answered his question.",
            "He immediately judged from the faces of his daughters and Prince S. that there was a thunderstorm brewing, and he himself already bore evidences of unusual perturbation of mind.",
            "He immediately button-holed Prince S., and standing at the front door, engaged in a whispered conversation with him. By the troubled aspect of both of them, when they entered the house, and approached Mrs. Epanchin, it was evident that they had been discussing very disturbing news.",
            "Little by little the family gathered together upstairs in Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2019s apartments, and Prince Muishkin found himself alone on the verandah when he arrived. He settled himself in a corner and sat waiting, though he knew not what he expected. It never struck him that he had better go away, with all this disturbance in the house. He seemed to have forgotten all the world, and to be ready to sit on where he was for years on end. From upstairs he caught sounds of excited conversation every now and then.",
            "He could not say how long he sat there. It grew late and became quite dark.",
            "Suddenly Aglaya entered the verandah. She seemed to be quite calm, though a little pale.",
            "Observing the prince, whom she evidently did not expect to see there, alone in the corner, she smiled, and approached him:",
            "\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d she asked.",
            "The prince muttered something, blushed, and jumped up; but Aglaya immediately sat down beside him; so he reseated himself.",
            "She looked suddenly, but attentively into his face, then at the window, as though thinking of something else, and then again at him.",
            "\u201cPerhaps she wants to laugh at me,\u201d thought the prince, \u201cbut no; for if she did she certainly would do so.\u201d",
            "\u201cWould you like some tea? I\u2019ll order some,\u201d she said, after a minute or two of silence.",
            "\u201cN-no thanks, I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t know! How can you not know? By-the-by, look here\u2014if someone were to challenge you to a duel, what should you do? I wished to ask you this\u2014some time ago\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy? Nobody would ever challenge me to a duel!\u201d",

            "\u201cN-no!\u2014I don\u2019t think so. A coward is a man who is afraid and runs away; the man who is frightened but does not run away, is not quite a coward,\u201d said the prince with a smile, after a moment\u2019s thought.",
            "\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t run away?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t think I should run away,\u201d replied the prince, laughing outright at last at Aglaya\u2019s questions.",
            "\u201cThough I am a woman, I should certainly not run away for anything,\u201d said Aglaya, in a slightly pained voice. \u201cHowever, I see you are laughing at me and twisting your face up as usual in order to make yourself look more interesting. Now tell me, they generally shoot at twenty paces, don\u2019t they? At ten, sometimes? I suppose if at ten they must be either wounded or killed, mustn\u2019t they?\u201d",

            "\u201cWell, a soldier once told me that they were always ordered to aim at the middle of the body. So you see they don\u2019t aim at the chest or head; they aim lower on purpose. I asked some officer about this afterwards, and he said it was perfectly true.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is probably when they fire from a long distance.\u201d",
            "\u201cCan you shoot at all?\u201d",

            "\u201cThen, you don\u2019t know how, for it is a matter that needs practice. Now listen and learn; in the first place buy good powder, not damp (they say it mustn\u2019t be at all damp, but very dry), some fine kind it is\u2014you must ask for _pistol_ powder, not the stuff they load cannons with. They say one makes the bullets oneself, somehow or other. Have you got a pistol?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo\u2014and I don\u2019t want one,\u201d said the prince, laughing.",
            "\u201cOh, what _nonsense!_ You must buy one. French or English are the best, they say. Then take a little powder, about a thimbleful, or perhaps two, and pour it into the barrel. Better put plenty. Then push in a bit of felt (it _must_ be felt, for some reason or other); you can easily get a bit off some old mattress, or off a door; it\u2019s used to keep the cold out. Well, when you have pushed the felt down, put the bullet in; do you hear now? The bullet last and the powder first, not the other way, or the pistol won\u2019t shoot. What are you laughing at? I wish you to buy a pistol and practise every day, and you must learn to hit a mark for _certain_; will you?\u201d",
            "The prince only laughed. Aglaya stamped her foot with annoyance.",
            "Her serious air, however, during this conversation had surprised him considerably. He had a feeling that he ought to be asking her something, that there was something he wanted to find out far more important than how to load a pistol; but his thoughts had all scattered, and he was only aware that she was sitting by him, and talking to him, and that he was looking at her; as to what she happened to be saying to him, that did not matter in the least.",
            "The general now appeared on the verandah, coming from upstairs. He was on his way out, with an expression of determination on his face, and of preoccupation and worry also.",

            "\u201c_Au revoir_, then!\u201d said Aglaya, holding out her hand to the prince.",
            "It was quite dark now, and Muishkin could not see her face clearly, but a minute or two later, when he and the general had left the villa, he suddenly flushed up, and squeezed his right hand tightly.",
            "It appeared that he and the general were going in the same direction. In spite of the lateness of the hour, the general was hurrying away to talk to someone upon some important subject. Meanwhile he talked incessantly but disconnectedly to the prince, and continually brought in the name of Lizabetha Prokofievna.",
            "If the prince had been in a condition to pay more attention to what the general was saying, he would have discovered that the latter was desirous of drawing some information out of him, or indeed of asking him some question outright; but that he could not make up his mind to come to the point.",
            "Muishkin was so absent, that from the very first he could not attend to a word the other was saying; and when the general suddenly stopped before him with some excited question, he was obliged to confess, ignominiously, that he did not know in the least what he had been talking about.",
            "The general shrugged his shoulders.",
            "\u201cHow strange everyone, yourself included, has become of late,\u201d said he. \u201cI was telling you that I cannot in the least understand Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2019s ideas and agitations. She is in hysterics up there, and moans and says that we have been \u2018shamed and disgraced.\u2019 How? Why? When? By whom? I confess that I am very much to blame myself; I do not conceal the fact; but the conduct, the outrageous behaviour of this woman, must really be kept within limits, by the police if necessary, and I am just on my way now to talk the question over and make some arrangements. It can all be managed quietly and gently, even kindly, and without the slightest fuss or scandal. I foresee that the future is pregnant with events, and that there is much that needs explanation. There is intrigue in the wind; but if on one side nothing is known, on the other side nothing will be explained. If I have heard nothing about it, nor have _you_, nor _he_, nor _she_\u2014who _has_ heard about it, I should like to know? How _can_ all this be explained except by the fact that half of it is mirage or moonshine, or some hallucination of that sort?\u201d",
            "\u201c_She_ is insane,\u201d muttered the prince, suddenly recollecting all that had passed, with a spasm of pain at his heart.",
            "\u201cI too had that idea, and I slept in peace. But now I see that their opinion is more correct. I do not believe in the theory of madness! The woman has no common sense; but she is not only not insane, she is artful to a degree. Her outburst of this evening about Evgenie\u2019s uncle proves that conclusively. It was _villainous_, simply jesuitical, and it was all for some special purpose.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat about Evgenie\u2019s uncle?\u201d",
            "\u201cMy goodness, Lef Nicolaievitch, why, you can\u2019t have heard a single word I said! Look at me, I\u2019m still trembling all over with the dreadful shock! It is that that kept me in town so late. Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s uncle\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWell?\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cShot himself this morning, at seven o\u2019clock. A respected, eminent old man of seventy; and exactly point for point as she described it; a sum of money, a considerable sum of government money, missing!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, how could she\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat, know of it? Ha, ha, ha! Why, there was a whole crowd round her the moment she appeared on the scenes here. You know what sort of people surround her nowadays, and solicit the honour of her \u2018acquaintance.\u2019 Of course she might easily have heard the news from someone coming from town. All Petersburg, if not all Pavlofsk, knows it by now. Look at the slyness of her observation about Evgenie\u2019s uniform! I mean, her remark that he had retired just in time! There\u2019s a venomous hint for you, if you like! No, no! there\u2019s no insanity there! Of course I refuse to believe that Evgenie Pavlovitch could have known beforehand of the catastrophe; that is, that at such and such a day at seven o\u2019clock, and all that; but he might well have had a presentiment of the truth. And I\u2014all of us\u2014Prince S. and everybody, believed that he was to inherit a large fortune from this uncle. It\u2019s dreadful, horrible! Mind, I don\u2019t suspect Evgenie of anything, be quite clear on that point; but the thing is a little suspicious, nevertheless. Prince S. can\u2019t get over it. Altogether it is a very extraordinary combination of circumstances.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat suspicion attaches to Evgenie Pavlovitch?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, none at all! He has behaved very well indeed. I didn\u2019t mean to drop any sort of hint. His own fortune is intact, I believe. Lizabetha Prokofievna, of course, refuses to listen to anything. That\u2019s the worst of it all, these family catastrophes or quarrels, or whatever you like to call them. You know, prince, you are a friend of the family, so I don\u2019t mind telling you; it now appears that Evgenie Pavlovitch proposed to Aglaya a month ago, and was refused.\u201d",
            "\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cWhy? Do you know anything about it? Look here,\u201d continued the general, more agitated than ever, and trembling with excitement, \u201cmaybe I have been letting the cat out of the bag too freely with you, if so, it is because you are\u2014that sort of man, you know! Perhaps you have some special information?\u201d",
            "\u201cI know nothing about Evgenie Pavlovitch!\u201d said the prince.",

I won\u2019t stand it! We have just had a terrible scene!\u2014mind, I speak to you as I would to my own son! Aglaya laughs at her mother. Her sisters guessed about Evgenie having proposed and been rejected, and told Lizabetha.",
            "\u201cI tell you, my dear fellow, Aglaya is such an extraordinary, such a self-willed, fantastical little creature, you wouldn\u2019t believe it! Every high quality, every brilliant trait of heart and mind, are to be found in her, and, with it all, so much caprice and mockery, such wild fancies\u2014indeed, a little devil! She has just been laughing at her mother to her very face, and at her sisters, and at Prince S., and everybody\u2014and of course she always laughs at me! You know I love the child\u2014I love her even when she laughs at me, and I believe the wild little creature has a special fondness for me for that very reason. She is fonder of me than any of the others. I dare swear she has had a good laugh at _you_ before now! You were having a quiet talk just now, I observed, after all the thunder and lightning upstairs. She was sitting with you just as though there had been no row at all.\u201d",
            "The prince blushed painfully in the darkness, and closed his right hand tightly, but he said nothing.",
            "\u201cMy dear good Prince Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d began the general again, suddenly, \u201cboth I and Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2014(who has begun to respect you once more, and me through you, goodness knows why!)\u2014we both love you very sincerely, and esteem you, in spite of any appearances to the contrary. But you\u2019ll admit what a riddle it must have been for us when that calm, cold, little spitfire, Aglaya\u2014(for she stood up to her mother and answered her questions with inexpressible contempt, and mine still more so, because, like a fool, I thought it my duty to assert myself as head of the family)\u2014when Aglaya stood up of a sudden and informed us that \u2018that madwoman\u2019 (strangely enough, she used exactly the same expression as you did) \u2018has taken it into her head to marry me to Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, and therefore is doing her best to choke Evgenie Pavlovitch off, and rid the house of him.\u2019 That\u2019s what she said. She would not give the slightest explanation; she burst out laughing, banged the door, and went away. We all stood there with our mouths open. Well, I was told afterwards of your little passage with Aglaya this afternoon, and\u2014and\u2014dear prince\u2014you are a good, sensible fellow, don\u2019t be angry if I speak out\u2014she is laughing at you, my boy! She is enjoying herself like a child, at your expense, and therefore, since she is a child, don\u2019t be angry with her, and don\u2019t think anything of it. I assure you, she is simply making a fool of you, just as she does with one and all of us out of pure lack of something better to do. Well\u2014good-bye! You know our feelings, don\u2019t you\u2014our sincere feelings for yourself? They are unalterable, you know, dear boy, under all circumstances, but\u2014Well, here we part; I must go down to the right. Rarely have I sat so uncomfortably in my saddle, as they say, as I now sit. And people talk of the charms of a country holiday!\u201d",
            "Left to himself at the cross-roads, the prince glanced around him, quickly crossed the road towards the lighted window of a neighbouring house, and unfolded a tiny scrap of paper which he had held clasped in his right hand during the whole of his conversation with the general.",
            "He read the note in the uncertain rays that fell from the window. It was as follows:",
            "\u201cTomorrow morning, I shall be at the green bench in the park at seven, and shall wait there for you. I have made up my mind to speak to you about a most important matter which closely concerns yourself.",
            "\u201cP.S.\u2014I trust that you will not show this note to anyone. Though I am ashamed of giving you such instructions, I feel that I must do so, considering what you are. I therefore write the words, and blush for your simple character.",
            "\u201cP.P.S.\u2014It is the same green bench that I showed you before. There! aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself? I felt that it was necessary to repeat even that information.\u201d",
            "The note was written and folded anyhow, evidently in a great hurry, and probably just before Aglaya had come down to the verandah.",
            "In inexpressible agitation, amounting almost to fear, the prince slipped quickly away from the window, away from the light, like a frightened thief, but as he did so he collided violently with some gentleman who seemed to spring from the earth at his feet.",
            "\u201cI was watching for you, prince,\u201d said the individual.",
            "\u201cIs that you, Keller?\u201d said the prince, in surprise.",
            "\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been looking for you. I waited for you at the Epanchins\u2019 house, but of course I could not come in. I dogged you from behind as you walked along with the general. Well, prince, here is Keller, absolutely at your service\u2014command him!\u2014ready to sacrifice himself\u2014even to die in case of need.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut\u2014why?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, why?\u2014Of course you\u2019ll be challenged! That was young Lieutenant Moloftsoff. I know him, or rather of him; he won\u2019t pass an insult. He will take no notice of Rogojin and myself, and, therefore, you are the only one left to account for. You\u2019ll have to pay the piper, prince. He has been asking about you, and undoubtedly his friend will call on you tomorrow\u2014perhaps he is at your house already. If you would do me the honour to have me for a second, prince, I should be happy. That\u2019s why I have been looking for you now.\u201d",
            "\u201cDuel! You\u2019ve come to talk about a duel, too!\u201d The prince burst out laughing, to the great astonishment of Keller. He laughed unrestrainedly, and Keller, who had been on pins and needles, and in a fever of excitement to offer himself as \u201csecond,\u201d was very near being offended.",
            "\u201cYou caught him by the arms, you know, prince. No man of proper pride can stand that sort of treatment in public.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, and he gave me a fearful dig in the chest,\u201d cried the prince, still laughing. \u201cWhat are we to fight about? I shall beg his pardon, that\u2019s all. But if we must fight\u2014we\u2019ll fight! Let him have a shot at me, by all means; I should rather like it. Ha, ha, ha! I know how to load a pistol now; do you know how to load a pistol, Keller? First, you have to buy the powder, you know; it mustn\u2019t be wet, and it mustn\u2019t be that coarse stuff that they load cannons with\u2014it must be pistol powder. Then you pour the powder in, and get hold of a bit of felt from some door, and then shove the bullet in. But don\u2019t shove the bullet in before the powder, because the thing wouldn\u2019t go off\u2014do you hear, Keller, the thing wouldn\u2019t go off! Ha, ha, ha! Isn\u2019t that a grand reason, Keller, my friend, eh? Do you know, my dear fellow, I really must kiss you, and embrace you, this very moment. Ha, ha! How was it you so suddenly popped up in front of me as you did? Come to my house as soon as you can, and we\u2019ll have some champagne. We\u2019ll all get drunk! Do you know I have a dozen of champagne in Lebedeff\u2019s cellar? Lebedeff sold them to me the day after I arrived. I took the lot. We\u2019ll invite everybody! Are you going to do any sleeping tonight?\u201d",
            "\u201cAs much as usual, prince\u2014why?\u201d",
            "\u201cPleasant dreams then\u2014ha, ha!\u201d",
            "The prince crossed the road, and disappeared into the park, leaving the astonished Keller in a state of ludicrous wonder. He had never before seen the prince in such a strange condition of mind, and could not have imagined the possibility of it.",
            "\u201cFever, probably,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cfor the man is all nerves, and this business has been a little too much for him. He is not _afraid_, that\u2019s clear; that sort never funks! H\u2019m! champagne! That was an interesting item of news, at all events!\u2014Twelve bottles! Dear me, that\u2019s a very respectable little stock indeed! I bet anything Lebedeff lent somebody money on deposit of this dozen of champagne. Hum! he\u2019s a nice fellow, is this prince! I like this sort of man. Well, I needn\u2019t be wasting time here, and if it\u2019s a case of champagne, why\u2014there\u2019s no time like the present!\u201d",
            "That the prince was almost in a fever was no more than the truth. He wandered about the park for a long while, and at last came to himself in a lonely avenue. He was vaguely conscious that he had already paced this particular walk\u2014from that large, dark tree to the bench at the other end\u2014about a hundred yards altogether\u2014at least thirty times backwards and forwards.",
            "As to recollecting what he had been thinking of all that time, he could not. He caught himself, however, indulging in one thought which made him roar with laughter, though there was nothing really to laugh at in it; but he felt that he must laugh, and go on laughing.",
            "It struck him that the idea of the duel might not have occurred to Keller alone, but that his lesson in the art of pistol-loading might have been not altogether accidental! \u201cPooh! nonsense!\u201d he said to himself, struck by another thought, of a sudden. \u201cWhy, she was immensely surprised to find me there on the verandah, and laughed and talked about _tea!_ And yet she had this little note in her hand, therefore she must have known that I was sitting there. So why was she surprised? Ha, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "He pulled the note out and kissed it; then paused and reflected. \u201cHow strange it all is! how strange!\u201d he muttered, melancholy enough now. In moments of great joy, he invariably felt a sensation of melancholy come over him\u2014he could not tell why.",
            "He looked intently around him, and wondered why he had come here; he was very tired, so he approached the bench and sat down on it. Around him was profound silence; the music in the Vauxhall was over. The park seemed quite empty, though it was not, in reality, later than half-past eleven. It was a quiet, warm, clear night\u2014a real Petersburg night of early June; but in the dense avenue, where he was sitting, it was almost pitch dark.",
            "If anyone had come up at this moment and told him that he was in love, passionately in love, he would have rejected the idea with astonishment, and, perhaps, with irritation. And if anyone had added that Aglaya\u2019s note was a love-letter, and that it contained an appointment to a lover\u2019s rendezvous, he would have blushed with shame for the speaker, and, probably, have challenged him to a duel.",
            "All this would have been perfectly sincere on his part. He had never for a moment entertained the idea of the possibility of this girl loving him, or even of such a thing as himself falling in love with her. The possibility of being loved himself, \u201ca man like me,\u201d as he put it, he ranked among ridiculous suppositions. It appeared to him that it was simply a joke on Aglaya\u2019s part, if there really were anything in it at all; but that seemed to him quite natural. His preoccupation was caused by something different.",
            "As to the few words which the general had let slip about Aglaya laughing at everybody, and at himself most of all\u2014he entirely believed them. He did not feel the slightest sensation of offence; on the contrary, he was quite certain that it was as it should be.",
            "His whole thoughts were now as to next morning early; he would see her; he would sit by her on that little green bench, and listen to how pistols were loaded, and look at her. He wanted nothing more.",
            "The question as to what she might have to say of special interest to himself occurred to him once or twice. He did not doubt, for a moment, that she really had some such subject of conversation in store, but so very little interested in the matter was he that it did not strike him to wonder what it could be. The crunch of gravel on the path suddenly caused him to raise his head.",
            "A man, whose face it was difficult to see in the gloom, approached the bench, and sat down beside him. The prince peered into his face, and recognized the livid features of Rogojin.",
            "\u201cI knew you\u2019d be wandering about somewhere here. I didn\u2019t have to look for you very long,\u201d muttered the latter between his teeth.",
            "It was the first time they had met since the encounter on the staircase at the hotel.",
            "Painfully surprised as he was at this sudden apparition of Rogojin, the prince, for some little while, was unable to collect his thoughts. Rogojin, evidently, saw and understood the impression he had made; and though he seemed more or less confused at first, yet he began talking with what looked like assumed ease and freedom. However, the prince soon changed his mind on this score, and thought that there was not only no affectation of indifference, but that Rogojin was not even particularly agitated. If there were a little apparent awkwardness, it was only in his words and gestures. The man could not change his heart.",
            "\u201cHow did you\u2014find me here?\u201d asked the prince for the sake of saying something.",
            "\u201cKeller told me (I found him at your place) that you were in the park. \u2018Of course he is!\u2019 I thought.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy so?\u201d asked the prince uneasily.",
            "Rogojin smiled, but did not explain.",
            "\u201cI received your letter, Lef Nicolaievitch\u2014what\u2019s the good of all that?\u2014It\u2019s no use, you know. I\u2019ve come to you from _her_,\u2014she bade me tell you that she must see you, she has something to say to you. She told me to find you today.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll come tomorrow. Now I\u2019m going home\u2014are you coming to my house?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy should I? I\u2019ve given you the message.\u2014Goodbye!\u201d",
            "\u201cWon\u2019t you come?\u201d asked the prince in a gentle voice.",
            "\u201cWhat an extraordinary man you are! I wonder at you!\u201d Rogojin laughed sarcastically.",
            "\u201cWhy do you hate me so?\u201d asked the prince, sadly. \u201cYou know yourself that all you suspected is quite unfounded. I felt you were still angry with me, though. Do you know why? Because you tried to kill me\u2014that\u2019s why you can\u2019t shake off your wrath against me. I tell you that I only remember the Parfen Rogojin with whom I exchanged crosses, and vowed brotherhood. I wrote you this in yesterday\u2019s letter, in order that you might forget all that madness on your part, and that you might not feel called to talk about it when we met. Why do you avoid me? Why do you hold your hand back from me? I tell you again, I consider all that has passed a delirium, an insane dream. I can understand all you did, and all you felt that day, as if it were myself. What you were then imagining was not the case, and could never be the case. Why, then, should there be anger between us?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what anger is!\u201d laughed Rogojin, in reply to the prince\u2019s heated words.",
            "He had moved a pace or two away, and was hiding his hands behind him.",
            "\u201cNo, it is impossible for me to come to your house again,\u201d he added slowly.",
            "\u201cWhy? Do you hate me so much as all that?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t love you, Lef Nicolaievitch, and, therefore, what would be the use of my coming to see you? You are just like a child\u2014you want a plaything, and it must be taken out and given you\u2014and then you don\u2019t know how to work it. You are simply repeating all you said in your letter, and what\u2019s the use? Of course I believe every word you say, and I know perfectly well that you neither did or ever can deceive me in any way, and yet, I don\u2019t love you. You write that you\u2019ve forgotten everything, and only remember your brother Parfen, with whom you exchanged crosses, and that you don\u2019t remember anything about the Rogojin who aimed a knife at your throat. What do you know about my feelings, eh?\u201d (Rogojin laughed disagreeably.) \u201cHere you are holding out your brotherly forgiveness to me for a thing that I have perhaps never repented of in the slightest degree. I did not think of it again all that evening; all my thoughts were centred on something else\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNot think of it again? Of course you didn\u2019t!\u201d cried the prince. \u201cAnd I dare swear that you came straight away down here to Pavlofsk to listen to the music and dog her about in the crowd, and stare at her, just as you did today. There\u2019s nothing surprising in that! If you hadn\u2019t been in that condition of mind that you could think of nothing but one subject, you would, probably, never have raised your knife against me. I had a presentiment of what you would do, that day, ever since I saw you first in the morning. Do you know yourself what you looked like? I knew you would try to murder me even at the very moment when we exchanged crosses. What did you take me to your mother for? Did you think to stay your hand by doing so? Perhaps you did not put your thoughts into words, but you and I were thinking the same thing, or feeling the same thing looming over us, at the same moment. What should you think of me now if you had not raised your knife to me\u2014the knife which God averted from my throat? I would have been guilty of suspecting you all the same\u2014and you would have intended the murder all the same; therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case. Come, don\u2019t frown; you needn\u2019t laugh at me, either. You say you haven\u2019t \u2018repented.\u2019 Repented! You probably couldn\u2019t, if you were to try; you dislike me too much for that. Why, if I were an angel of light, and as innocent before you as a babe, you would still loathe me if you believed that _she_ loved me, instead of loving yourself. That\u2019s jealousy\u2014that is the real jealousy.",
            "\u201cBut do you know what I have been thinking out during this last week, Parfen? I\u2019ll tell you. What if she loves you now better than anyone? And what if she torments you _because_ she loves you, and in proportion to her love for you, so she torments you the more? She won\u2019t tell you this, of course; you must have eyes to see. Why do you suppose she consents to marry you? She must have a reason, and that reason she will tell you some day. Some women desire the kind of love you give her, and she is probably one of these. Your love and your wild nature impress her. Do you know that a woman is capable of driving a man crazy almost, with her cruelties and mockeries, and feels not one single pang of regret, because she looks at him and says to herself, \u2018There! I\u2019ll torment this man nearly into his grave, and then, oh! how I\u2019ll compensate him for it all with my love!\u2019\u201d",
            "Rogojin listened to the end, and then burst out laughing:",

            "\u201cWhat? What can you have heard?\u201d said the prince, stammering.",
            "Rogojin continued to laugh loudly. He had listened to the prince\u2019s speech with curiosity and some satisfaction. The speaker\u2019s impulsive warmth had surprised and even comforted him.",
            "\u201cWhy, I\u2019ve not only heard of it; I see it for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen have you ever spoken like that before? It wasn\u2019t like yourself, prince. Why, if I hadn\u2019t heard this report about you, I should never have come all this way into the park\u2014at midnight, too!\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t understand you in the least, Parfen.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, _she_ told me all about it long ago, and tonight I saw for myself. I saw you at the music, you know, and whom you were sitting with. She swore to me yesterday, and again today, that you are madly in love with Aglaya Ivanovna. But that\u2019s all the same to me, prince, and it\u2019s not my affair at all; for if you have ceased to love _her_, _she_ has not ceased to love _you_. You know, of course, that she wants to marry you to that girl? She\u2019s sworn to it! Ha, ha! She says to me, \u2018Until then I won\u2019t marry you. When they go to church, we\u2019ll go too\u2014and not before.\u2019 What on earth does she mean by it? I don\u2019t know, and I never did. Either she loves you without limits or\u2014yet, if she loves you, why does she wish to marry you to another girl? She says, \u2018I want to see him happy,\u2019 which is to say\u2014she loves you.\u201d",
            "\u201cI wrote, and I say to you once more, that she is not in her right mind,\u201d said the prince, who had listened with anguish to what Rogojin said.",

At all events, she named the day this evening, as we left the gardens. \u2018In three weeks,\u2019 says she, \u2018and perhaps sooner, we shall be married.\u2019 She swore to it, took off her cross and kissed it. So it all depends upon you now, prince, You see! Ha, ha!\u201d",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s all madness. What you say about me, Parfen, never can and never will be. Tomorrow, I shall come and see you\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cHow can she be mad,\u201d Rogojin interrupted, \u201cwhen she is sane enough for other people and only mad for you? How can she write letters to _her_, if she\u2019s mad? If she were insane they would observe it in her letters.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat letters?\u201d said the prince, alarmed.",
            "\u201cShe writes to _her_\u2014and the girl reads the letters. Haven\u2019t you heard?\u2014You are sure to hear; she\u2019s sure to show you the letters herself.\u201d",
            "\u201cI won\u2019t believe this!\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cWhy, prince, you\u2019ve only gone a few steps along this road, I perceive. You are evidently a mere beginner. Wait a bit! Before long, you\u2019ll have your own detectives, you\u2019ll watch day and night, and you\u2019ll know every little thing that goes on there\u2014that is, if\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDrop that subject, Rogojin, and never mention it again. And listen: as I have sat here, and talked, and listened, it has suddenly struck me that tomorrow is my birthday. It must be about twelve o\u2019clock, now; come home with me\u2014do, and we\u2019ll see the day in! We\u2019ll have some wine, and you shall wish me\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2014but you, especially you, must wish me a good wish, and I shall wish you full happiness in return. Otherwise, hand me my cross back again. You didn\u2019t return it to me next day. Haven\u2019t you got it on now?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I have,\u201d said Rogojin.",
            "\u201cCome along, then. I don\u2019t wish to meet my new year without you\u2014my new life, I should say, for a new life is beginning for me. Did you know, Parfen, that a new life had begun for me?\u201d",

            "All the guests were known to the prince; but the curious part of the matter was that they had all arrived on the same evening, as though with one accord, although he had only himself recollected the fact that it was his birthday a few moments since.",
            "\u201cYou must have told somebody you were going to trot out the champagne, and that\u2019s why they are all come!\u201d muttered Rogojin, as the two entered the verandah. \u201cWe know all about that! You\u2019ve only to whistle and they come up in shoals!\u201d he continued, almost angrily. He was doubtless thinking of his own late experiences with his boon companions.",
            "All surrounded the prince with exclamations of welcome, and, on hearing that it was his birthday, with cries of congratulation and delight; many of them were very noisy.",
            "The presence of certain of those in the room surprised the prince vastly, but the guest whose advent filled him with the greatest wonder\u2014almost amounting to alarm\u2014was Evgenie Pavlovitch. The prince could not believe his eyes when he beheld the latter, and could not help thinking that something was wrong.",
            "Lebedeff ran up promptly to explain the arrival of all these gentlemen. He was himself somewhat intoxicated, but the prince gathered from his long-winded periods that the party had assembled quite naturally, and accidentally.",
            "First of all Hippolyte had arrived, early in the evening, and feeling decidedly better, had determined to await the prince on the verandah. There Lebedeff had joined him, and his household had followed\u2014that is, his daughters and General Ivolgin. Burdovsky had brought Hippolyte, and stayed on with him. Gania and Ptitsin had dropped in accidentally later on; then came Keller, and he and Colia insisted on having champagne. Evgenie Pavlovitch had only dropped in half an hour or so ago. Lebedeff had served the champagne readily.",
            "\u201cMy own though, prince, my own, mind,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019ll be some supper later on; my daughter is getting it ready now. Come and sit down, prince, we are all waiting for you, we want you with us. Fancy what we have been discussing! You know the question, \u2018to be or not to be,\u2019\u2014out of Hamlet! A contemporary theme! Quite up-to-date! Mr. Hippolyte has been eloquent to a degree. He won\u2019t go to bed, but he has only drunk a little champagne, and that can\u2019t do him any harm. Come along, prince, and settle the question. Everyone is waiting for you, sighing for the light of your luminous intelligence...\u201d",
            "The prince noticed the sweet, welcoming look on Vera Lebedeff\u2019s face, as she made her way towards him through the crowd. He held out his hand to her. She took it, blushing with delight, and wished him \u201ca happy life from that day forward.\u201d Then she ran off to the kitchen, where her presence was necessary to help in the preparations for supper. Before the prince\u2019s arrival she had spent some time on the terrace, listening eagerly to the conversation, though the visitors, mostly under the influence of wine, were discussing abstract subjects far beyond her comprehension. In the next room her younger sister lay on a wooden chest, sound asleep, with her mouth wide open; but the boy, Lebedeff\u2019s son, had taken up his position close beside Colia and Hippolyte, his face lit up with interest in the conversation of his father and the rest, to which he would willingly have listened for ten hours at a stretch.",
            "\u201cI have waited for you on purpose, and am very glad to see you arrive so happy,\u201d said Hippolyte, when the prince came forward to press his hand, immediately after greeting Vera.",
            "\u201cAnd how do you know that I am \u2018so happy\u2019?\u201d",
            "\u201cI can see it by your face! Say \u2018how do you do\u2019 to the others, and come and sit down here, quick\u2014I\u2019ve been waiting for you!\u201d he added, accentuating the fact that he had waited. On the prince\u2019s asking, \u201cWill it not be injurious to you to sit out so late?\u201d he replied that he could not believe that he had thought himself dying three days or so ago, for he never had felt better than this evening.",
            "Burdovsky next jumped up and explained that he had come in by accident, having escorted Hippolyte from town. He murmured that he was glad he had \u201cwritten nonsense\u201d in his letter, and then pressed the prince\u2019s hand warmly and sat down again.",
            "The prince approached Evgenie Pavlovitch last of all. The latter immediately took his arm.",
            "\u201cI have a couple of words to say to you,\u201d he began, \u201cand those on a very important matter; let\u2019s go aside for a minute or two.\u201d",
            "\u201cJust a couple of words!\u201d whispered another voice in the prince\u2019s other ear, and another hand took his other arm. Muishkin turned, and to his great surprise observed a red, flushed face and a droll-looking figure which he recognized at once as that of Ferdishenko. Goodness knows where he had turned up from!",
            "\u201cDo you remember Ferdishenko?\u201d he asked.",
            "\u201cWhere have you dropped from?\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cHe is sorry for his sins now, prince,\u201d cried Keller. \u201cHe did not want to let you know he was here; he was hidden over there in the corner,\u2014but he repents now, he feels his guilt.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, what has he done?\u201d",
            "\u201cI met him outside and brought him in\u2014he\u2019s a gentleman who doesn\u2019t often allow his friends to see him, of late\u2014but he\u2019s sorry now.\u201d",
            "\u201cDelighted, I\u2019m sure!\u2014I\u2019ll come back directly, gentlemen,\u2014sit down there with the others, please,\u2014excuse me one moment,\u201d said the host, getting away with difficulty in order to follow Evgenie.",
            "\u201cYou are very gay here,\u201d began the latter, \u201cand I have had quite a pleasant half-hour while I waited for you. Now then, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, this is what\u2019s the matter. I\u2019ve arranged it all with Moloftsoff, and have just come in to relieve your mind on that score. You need be under no apprehensions. He was very sensible, as he should be, of course, for I think he was entirely to blame himself.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat Moloftsoff?\u201d",
            "\u201cThe young fellow whose arms you held, don\u2019t you know? He was so wild with you that he was going to send a friend to you tomorrow morning.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat nonsense!\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course it is nonsense, and in nonsense it would have ended, doubtless; but you know these fellows, they\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cExcuse me, but I think you must have something else that you wished to speak about, Evgenie Pavlovitch?\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course, I have!\u201d said the other, laughing. \u201cYou see, my dear fellow, tomorrow, very early in the morning, I must be off to town about this unfortunate business (my uncle, you know!). Just imagine, my dear sir, it is all true\u2014word for word\u2014and, of course, everybody knew it excepting myself. All this has been such a blow to me that I have not managed to call in at the Epanchins\u2019. Tomorrow I shall not see them either, because I shall be in town. I may not be here for three days or more; in a word, my affairs are a little out of gear. But though my town business is, of course, most pressing, still I determined not to go away until I had seen you, and had a clear understanding with you upon certain points; and that without loss of time. I will wait now, if you will allow me, until the company departs; I may just as well, for I have nowhere else to go to, and I shall certainly not do any sleeping tonight; I\u2019m far too excited. And finally, I must confess that, though I know it is bad form to pursue a man in this way, I have come to beg your friendship, my dear prince. You are an unusual sort of a person; you don\u2019t lie at every step, as some men do; in fact, you don\u2019t lie at all, and there is a matter in which I need a true and sincere friend, for I really may claim to be among the number of bona fide unfortunates just now.\u201d",
            "He laughed again.",
            "\u201cBut the trouble is,\u201d said the prince, after a slight pause for reflection, \u201cthat goodness only knows when this party will break up. Hadn\u2019t we better stroll into the park? I\u2019ll excuse myself, there\u2019s no danger of their going away.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no! I have my reasons for wishing them not to suspect us of being engaged in any specially important conversation. There are gentry present who are a little too much interested in us. You are not aware of that perhaps, prince? It will be a great deal better if they see that we are friendly just in an ordinary way. They\u2019ll all go in a couple of hours, and then I\u2019ll ask you to give me twenty minutes\u2014half an hour at most.\u201d",
            "\u201cBy all means! I assure you I am delighted\u2014you need not have entered into all these explanations. As for your remarks about friendship with me\u2014thanks, very much indeed. You must excuse my being a little absent this evening. Do you know, I cannot somehow be attentive to anything just now?\u201d",
            "\u201cI see, I see,\u201d said Evgenie, smiling gently. His mirth seemed very near the surface this evening.",
            "\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d said the prince, startled.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t want you to suspect that I have simply come here to deceive you and pump information out of you!\u201d said Evgenie, still smiling, and without making any direct reply to the question.",
            "\u201cOh, but I haven\u2019t the slightest doubt that you did come to pump me,\u201d said the prince, laughing himself, at last; \u201cand I dare say you are quite prepared to deceive me too, so far as that goes. But what of that? I\u2019m not afraid of you; besides, you\u2019ll hardly believe it, I feel as though I really didn\u2019t care a scrap one way or the other, just now!\u2014And\u2014and\u2014and as you are a capital fellow, I am convinced of that, I dare say we really shall end by being good friends. I like you very much Evgenie Pavlovitch; I consider you a very good fellow indeed.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, in any case, you are a most delightful man to have to deal with, be the business what it may,\u201d concluded Evgenie. \u201cCome along now, I\u2019ll drink a glass to your health. I\u2019m charmed to have entered into alliance with you. By-the-by,\u201d he added suddenly, \u201chas this young Hippolyte come down to stay with you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to die at once, I should think, is he?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been half an hour here with him, and he\u2014\u201d",
            "Hippolyte had been waiting for the prince all this time, and had never ceased looking at him and Evgenie Pavlovitch as they conversed in the corner. He became much excited when they approached the table once more. He was disturbed in his mind, it seemed; perspiration stood in large drops on his forehead; in his gleaming eyes it was easy to read impatience and agitation; his gaze wandered from face to face of those present, and from object to object in the room, apparently without aim. He had taken a part, and an animated one, in the noisy conversation of the company; but his animation was clearly the outcome of fever. His talk was almost incoherent; he would break off in the middle of a sentence which he had begun with great interest, and forget what he had been saying. The prince discovered to his dismay that Hippolyte had been allowed to drink two large glasses of champagne; the one now standing by him being the third. All this he found out afterwards; at the moment he did not notice anything, very particularly.",
            "\u201cDo you know I am specially glad that today is your birthday!\u201d cried Hippolyte.",
            "\u201cWhy?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou\u2019ll soon see. D\u2019you know I had a feeling that there would be a lot of people here tonight? It\u2019s not the first time that my presentiments have been fulfilled. I wish I had known it was your birthday, I\u2019d have brought you a present\u2014perhaps I have got a present for you! Who knows? Ha, ha! How long is it now before daylight?\u201d",
            "\u201cNot a couple of hours,\u201d said Ptitsin, looking at his watch. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of daylight now? One can read all night in the open air without it,\u201d said someone.",
            "\u201cThe good of it! Well, I want just to see a ray of the sun,\u201d said Hippolyte. \u201cCan one drink to the sun\u2019s health, do you think, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I dare say one can; but you had better be calm and lie down, Hippolyte\u2014that\u2019s much more important.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are always preaching about resting; you are a regular nurse to me, prince. As soon as the sun begins to \u2018resound\u2019 in the sky\u2014what poet said that? \u2018The sun resounded in the sky.\u2019 It is beautiful, though there\u2019s no sense in it!\u2014then we will go to bed. Lebedeff, tell me, is the sun the source of life? What does the source, or \u2018spring,\u2019 of life really mean in the Apocalypse? You have heard of the \u2018Star that is called Wormwood,\u2019 prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cI have heard that Lebedeff explains it as the railroads that cover Europe like a net.\u201d",
            "Everybody laughed, and Lebedeff got up abruptly.",
            "\u201cNo! Allow me, that is not what we are discussing!\u201d he cried, waving his hand to impose silence. \u201cAllow me! With these gentlemen... all these gentlemen,\u201d he added, suddenly addressing the prince, \u201con certain points... that is...\u201d He thumped the table repeatedly, and the laughter increased. Lebedeff was in his usual evening condition, and had just ended a long and scientific argument, which had left him excited and irritable. On such occasions he was apt to evince a supreme contempt for his opponents.",
            "\u201cIt is not right! Half an hour ago, prince, it was agreed among us that no one should interrupt, no one should laugh, that each person was to express his thoughts freely; and then at the end, when everyone had spoken, objections might be made, even by the atheists. We chose the general as president. Now without some such rule and order, anyone might be shouted down, even in the loftiest and most profound thought....\u201d",
            "\u201cGo on! Go on! Nobody is going to interrupt you!\u201d cried several voices.",

            "\u201cI love these arguments, prince,\u201d said Keller, also more than half intoxicated, moving restlessly in his chair. \u201cScientific and political.\u201d Then, turning suddenly towards Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was seated near him: \u201cDo you know, I simply adore reading the accounts of the debates in the English parliament. Not that the discussions themselves interest me; I am not a politician, you know; but it delights me to see how they address each other \u2018the noble lord who agrees with me,\u2019 \u2018my honourable opponent who astonished Europe with his proposal,\u2019 \u2018the noble viscount sitting opposite\u2019\u2014all these expressions, all this parliamentarism of a free people, has an enormous attraction for me. It fascinates me, prince. I have always been an artist in the depths of my soul, I assure you, Evgenie Pavlovitch.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you mean to say,\u201d cried Gania, from the other corner, \u201cdo you mean to say that railways are accursed inventions, that they are a source of ruin to humanity, a poison poured upon the earth to corrupt the springs of life?\u201d",
            "Gavrila Ardalionovitch was in high spirits that evening, and it seemed to the prince that his gaiety was mingled with triumph. Of course he was only joking with Lebedeff, meaning to egg him on, but he grew excited himself at the same time.",
            "\u201cNot the railways, oh dear, no!\u201d replied Lebedeff, with a mixture of violent anger and extreme enjoyment. \u201cConsidered alone, the railways will not pollute the springs of life, but as a whole they are accursed. The whole tendency of our latest centuries, in its scientific and materialistic aspect, is most probably accursed.\u201d",
            "\u201cIs it certainly accursed?... or do you only mean it might be? That is an important point,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch.",

            "\u201cBut, on the other hand, more frank in the evening! In the evening sincere and frank,\u201d repeated Lebedeff, earnestly. \u201cMore candid, more exact, more honest, more honourable, and... although I may show you my weak side, I challenge you all; you atheists, for instance! How are you going to save the world? How find a straight road of progress, you men of science, of industry, of cooperation, of trades unions, and all the rest? How are you going to save it, I say? By what? By credit? What is credit? To what will credit lead you?\u201d",

He even pulled Colia\u2019s silver watch out of his hand, and looked at it eagerly. Then, as if he had forgotten everything, he stretched himself out on the sofa, put his hands behind his head, and looked up at the sky. After a minute or two he got up and came back to the table to listen to Lebedeff\u2019s outpourings, as the latter passionately commentated on Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s paradox.",
            "\u201cThat is an artful and traitorous idea. A smart notion,\u201d vociferated the clerk, \u201cthrown out as an apple of discord. But it is just. You are a scoffer, a man of the world, a cavalry officer, and, though not without brains, you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor how true. Yes, the laws of self-preservation and of self-destruction are equally powerful in this world. The devil will hold his empire over humanity until a limit of time which is still unknown. You laugh? You do not believe in the devil? Scepticism as to the devil is a French idea, and it is also a frivolous idea. Do you know who the devil is? Do you know his name? Although you don\u2019t know his name you make a mockery of his form, following the example of Voltaire. You sneer at his hoofs, at his tail, at his horns\u2014all of them the produce of your imagination! In reality the devil is a great and terrible spirit, with neither hoofs, nor tail, nor horns; it is you who have endowed him with these attributes! But... he is not the question just now!\u201d",

We hurry and push and hustle, for the good of humanity! \u2018The world is becoming too noisy, too commercial!\u2019 groans some solitary thinker. \u2018Undoubtedly it is, but the noise of waggons bearing bread to starving humanity is of more value than tranquillity of soul,\u2019 replies another triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride. As for me, I don\u2019t believe in these waggons bringing bread to humanity. For, founded on no moral principle, these may well, even in the act of carrying bread to humanity, coldly exclude a considerable portion of humanity from enjoying it; that has been seen more than once.\u201d",

I, perhaps, might be the first to set a light to the fuel, and then run away. But, again, I must repeat, that is not the question.\u201d",

We are told by historians that widespread famines occurred in those days every two or three years, and such was the condition of things that men actually had recourse to cannibalism, in secret, of course. One of these cannibals, who had reached a good age, declared of his own free will that during the course of his long and miserable life he had personally killed and eaten, in the most profound secrecy, sixty monks, not to mention several children; the number of the latter he thought was about six, an insignificant total when compared with the enormous mass of ecclesiastics consumed by him. As to adults, laymen that is to say, he had never touched them.\u201d",
            "The president joined in the general outcry.",

            "\u201cGeneral, remember the siege of Kars! And you, gentlemen, I assure you my anecdote is the naked truth. I may remark that reality, although it is governed by invariable law, has at times a resemblance to falsehood. In fact, the truer a thing is the less true it sounds.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut could anyone possibly eat sixty monks?\u201d objected the scoffing listeners.",
            "\u201cIt is quite clear that he did not eat them all at once, but in a space of fifteen or twenty years: from that point of view the thing is comprehensible and natural...\u201d",

            "\u201cAnd natural,\u201d repeated Lebedeff with pedantic obstinacy. \u201cBesides, a Catholic monk is by nature excessively curious; it would be quite easy therefore to entice him into a wood, or some secret place, on false pretences, and there to deal with him as said. But I do not dispute in the least that the number of persons consumed appears to denote a spice of greediness.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is perhaps true, gentlemen,\u201d said the prince, quietly. He had been listening in silence up to that moment without taking part in the conversation, but laughing heartily with the others from time to time. Evidently he was delighted to see that everybody was amused, that everybody was talking at once, and even that everybody was drinking. It seemed as if he were not intending to speak at all, when suddenly he intervened in such a serious voice that everyone looked at him with interest.",
            "\u201cIt is true that there were frequent famines at that time, gentlemen. I have often heard of them, though I do not know much history. But it seems to me that it must have been so. When I was in Switzerland I used to look with astonishment at the many ruins of feudal castles perched on the top of steep and rocky heights, half a mile at least above sea-level, so that to reach them one had to climb many miles of stony tracks. A castle, as you know, is, a kind of mountain of stones\u2014a dreadful, almost an impossible, labour! Doubtless the builders were all poor men, vassals, and had to pay heavy taxes, and to keep up the priesthood. How, then, could they provide for themselves, and when had they time to plough and sow their fields? The greater number must, literally, have died of starvation. I have sometimes asked myself how it was that these communities were not utterly swept off the face of the earth, and how they could possibly survive. Lebedeff is not mistaken, in my opinion, when he says that there were cannibals in those days, perhaps in considerable numbers; but I do not understand why he should have dragged in the monks, nor what he means by that.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is undoubtedly because, in the twelfth century, monks were the only people one could eat; they were the fat, among many lean,\u201d said Gavrila Ardalionovitch.",
            "\u201cA brilliant idea, and most true!\u201d cried Lebedeff, \u201cfor he never even touched the laity. Sixty monks, and not a single layman! It is a terrible idea, but it is historic, it is statistic; it is indeed one of those facts which enables an intelligent historian to reconstruct the physiognomy of a special epoch, for it brings out this further point with mathematical accuracy, that the clergy were in those days sixty times richer and more flourishing than the rest of humanity and perhaps sixty times fatter also...\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are exaggerating, you are exaggerating, Lebedeff!\u201d cried his hearers, amid laughter.",
            "\u201cI admit that it is an historic thought, but what is your conclusion?\u201d asked the prince.",
            "He spoke so seriously in addressing Lebedeff, that his tone contrasted quite comically with that of the others. They were very nearly laughing at him, too, but he did not notice it.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t you see he is a lunatic, prince?\u201d whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch in his ear. \u201cSomeone told me just now that he is a bit touched on the subject of lawyers, that he has a mania for making speeches and intends to pass the examinations. I am expecting a splendid burlesque now.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy conclusion is vast,\u201d replied Lebedeff, in a voice like thunder. \u201cLet us examine first the psychological and legal position of the criminal. We see that in spite of the difficulty of finding other food, the accused, or, as we may say, my client, has often during his peculiar life exhibited signs of repentance, and of wishing to give up this clerical diet. Incontrovertible facts prove this assertion. He has eaten five or six children, a relatively insignificant number, no doubt, but remarkable enough from another point of view. It is manifest that, pricked by remorse\u2014for my client is religious, in his way, and has a conscience, as I shall prove later\u2014and desiring to extenuate his sin as far as possible, he has tried six times at least to substitute lay nourishment for clerical. That this was merely an experiment we can hardly doubt: for if it had been only a question of gastronomic variety, six would have been too few; why only six? Why not thirty? But if we regard it as an experiment, inspired by the fear of committing new sacrilege, then this number six becomes intelligible. Six attempts to calm his remorse, and the pricking of his conscience, would amply suffice, for these attempts could scarcely have been happy ones. In my humble opinion, a child is too small; I should say, not sufficient; which would result in four or five times more lay children than monks being required in a given time. The sin, lessened on the one hand, would therefore be increased on the other, in quantity, not in quality. Please understand, gentlemen, that in reasoning thus, I am taking the point of view which might have been taken by a criminal of the middle ages. As for myself, a man of the late nineteenth century, I, of course, should reason differently; I say so plainly, and therefore you need not jeer at me nor mock me, gentlemen. As for you, general, it is still more unbecoming on your part. In the second place, and giving my own personal opinion, a child\u2019s flesh is not a satisfying diet; it is too insipid, too sweet; and the criminal, in making these experiments, could have satisfied neither his conscience nor his appetite. I am about to conclude, gentlemen; and my conclusion contains a reply to one of the most important questions of that day and of our own! This criminal ended at last by denouncing himself to the clergy, and giving himself up to justice. We cannot but ask, remembering the penal system of that day, and the tortures that awaited him\u2014the wheel, the stake, the fire!\u2014we cannot but ask, I repeat, what induced him to accuse himself of this crime? Why did he not simply stop short at the number sixty, and keep his secret until his last breath? Why could he not simply leave the monks alone, and go into the desert to repent? Or why not become a monk himself? That is where the puzzle comes in! There must have been something stronger than the stake or the fire, or even than the habits of twenty years! There must have been an idea more powerful than all the calamities and sorrows of this world, famine or torture, leprosy or plague\u2014an idea which entered into the heart, directed and enlarged the springs of life, and made even that hell supportable to humanity! Show me a force, a power like that, in this our century of vices and railways! I might say, perhaps, in our century of steamboats and railways, but I repeat in our century of vices and railways, because I am drunk but truthful! Show me a single idea which unites men nowadays with half the strength that it had in those centuries, and dare to maintain that the \u2018springs of life\u2019 have not been polluted and weakened beneath this \u2018star,\u2019 beneath this network in which men are entangled! Don\u2019t talk to me about your prosperity, your riches, the rarity of famine, the rapidity of the means of transport! There is more of riches, but less of force. The idea uniting heart and soul to heart and soul exists no more. All is loose, soft, limp\u2014we are all of us limp.... Enough, gentlemen! I have done. That is not the question. No, the question is now, excellency, I believe, to sit down to the banquet you are about to provide for us!\u201d",
            "Lebedeff had roused great indignation in some of his auditors (it should be remarked that the bottles were constantly uncorked during his speech); but this unexpected conclusion calmed even the most turbulent spirits. \u201cThat\u2019s how a clever barrister makes a good point!\u201d said he, when speaking of his peroration later on. The visitors began to laugh and chatter once again; the committee left their seats, and stretched their legs on the terrace. Keller alone was still disgusted with Lebedeff and his speech; he turned from one to another, saying in a loud voice:",

He began by putting on his spectacles, then he opened a large black book; his white beard, and his two medals on his breast, recalling acts of charity, all added to his impressiveness. He began in a stern voice, and before him generals, hard men of the world, bowed down, and ladies fell to the ground fainting. But this one here\u2014he ends by announcing a banquet! That is not the real thing!\u201d",
            "Ptitsin listened and smiled, then turned as if to get his hat; but if he had intended to leave, he changed his mind. Before the others had risen from the table, Gania had suddenly left off drinking, and pushed away his glass, a dark shadow seemed to come over his face. When they all rose, he went and sat down by Rogojin. It might have been believed that quite friendly relations existed between them. Rogojin, who had also seemed on the point of going away now sat motionless, his head bent, seeming to have forgotten his intention. He had drunk no wine, and appeared absorbed in reflection. From time to time he raised his eyes, and examined everyone present; one might have imagined that he was expecting something very important to himself, and that he had decided to wait for it. The prince had taken two or three glasses of champagne, and seemed cheerful. As he rose he noticed Evgenie Pavlovitch, and, remembering the appointment he had made with him, smiled pleasantly. Evgenie Pavlovitch made a sign with his head towards Hippolyte, whom he was attentively watching. The invalid was fast asleep, stretched out on the sofa.",

What did he talk about? Is it true, prince, that you once declared that \u2018beauty would save the world\u2019? Great Heaven! The prince says that beauty saves the world! And I declare that he only has such playful ideas because he\u2019s in love! Gentlemen, the prince is in love. I guessed it the moment he came in. Don\u2019t blush, prince; you make me sorry for you.

            "\u201cGentlemen, gentlemen! I am about to break the seal,\u201d he continued, with determination. \u201cI\u2014I\u2014of course I don\u2019t insist upon anyone listening if they do not wish to.\u201d",
            "With trembling fingers he broke the seal and drew out several sheets of paper, smoothed them out before him, and began sorting them.",
            "\u201cWhat on earth does all this mean? What\u2019s he going to read?\u201d muttered several voices. Others said nothing; but one and all sat down and watched with curiosity. They began to think something strange might really be about to happen. Vera stood and trembled behind her father\u2019s chair, almost in tears with fright; Colia was nearly as much alarmed as she was. Lebedeff jumped up and put a couple of candles nearer to Hippolyte, so that he might see better.",
            "\u201cGentlemen, this\u2014you\u2019ll soon see what this is,\u201d began Hippolyte, and suddenly commenced his reading.",

Surely I can never have seriously written such a silly motto as that? Look here, gentlemen, I beg to give notice that all this is very likely terrible nonsense. It is only a few ideas of mine. If you think that there is anything mysterious coming\u2014or in a word\u2014\u201d",

            "Of course nobody knew what Rogojin meant by this; but his words made a deep impression upon all. Everyone seemed to see in a flash the same idea.",
            "As for Hippolyte, their effect upon him was astounding. He trembled so that the prince was obliged to support him, and would certainly have cried out, but that his voice seemed to have entirely left him for the moment. For a minute or two he could not speak at all, but panted and stared at Rogojin. At last he managed to ejaculate:",

            "\u201cCame where? What do you mean?\u201d asked Rogojin, amazed. But Hippolyte, panting and choking with excitement, interrupted him violently.",

            "\u201cIt was you,\u201d he murmured, almost in a whisper, but with absolute conviction. \u201cYes, it was you who came to my room and sat silently on a chair at my window for a whole hour\u2014more! It was between one and two at night; you rose and went out at about three. It was you, you! Why you should have frightened me so, why you should have wished to torment me like that, I cannot tell\u2014but you it was.\u201d",

            "For the first five minutes the reader\u2019s voice continued to tremble, and he read disconnectedly and unevenly; but gradually his voice strengthened. Occasionally a violent fit of coughing stopped him, but his animation grew with the progress of the reading\u2014as did also the disagreeable impression which it made upon his audience,\u2014until it reached the highest pitch of excitement.",

            "\u201cYesterday morning the prince came to see me. Among other things he asked me to come down to his villa. I knew he would come and persuade me to this step, and that he would adduce the argument that it would be easier for me to die \u2018among people and green trees,\u2019\u2014as he expressed it. But today he did not say \u2018die,\u2019 he said \u2018live.\u2019 It is pretty much the same to me, in my position, which he says. When I asked him why he made such a point of his \u2018green trees,\u2019 he told me, to my astonishment, that he had heard that last time I was in Pavlofsk I had said that I had come \u2018to have a last look at the trees.\u2019",
            "\u201cWhen I observed that it was all the same whether one died among trees or in front of a blank brick wall, as here, and that it was not worth making any fuss over a fortnight, he agreed at once. But he insisted that the good air at Pavlofsk and the greenness would certainly cause a physical change for the better, and that my excitement, and my _dreams_, would be perhaps relieved. I remarked to him, with a smile, that he spoke like a materialist, and he answered that he had always been one. As he never tells a lie, there must be something in his words. His smile is a pleasant one. I have had a good look at him. I don\u2019t know whether I like him or not; and I have no time to waste over the question. The hatred which I felt for him for five months has become considerably modified, I may say, during the last month. Who knows, perhaps I am going to Pavlofsk on purpose to see him! But why do I leave my chamber? Those who are sentenced to death should not leave their cells. If I had not formed a final resolve, but had decided to wait until the last minute, I should not leave my room, or accept his invitation to come and die at Pavlofsk. I must be quick and finish this explanation before tomorrow. I shall have no time to read it over and correct it, for I must read it tomorrow to the prince and two or three witnesses whom I shall probably find there.",
            "\u201cAs it will be absolutely true, without a touch of falsehood, I am curious to see what impression it will make upon me myself at the moment when I read it out. This is my \u2018last and solemn\u2019\u2014but why need I call it that? There is no question about the truth of it, for it is not worthwhile lying for a fortnight; a fortnight of life is not itself worth having, which is a proof that I write nothing here but pure truth.",
            "(\u201cN.B.\u2014Let me remember to consider; am I mad at this moment, or not? or rather at these moments? I have been told that consumptives sometimes do go out of their minds for a while in the last stages of the malady. I can prove this tomorrow when I read it out, by the impression it makes upon the audience. I must settle this question once and for all, otherwise I can\u2019t go on with anything.)",
            "\u201cI believe I have just written dreadful nonsense; but there\u2019s no time for correcting, as I said before. Besides that, I have made myself a promise not to alter a single word of what I write in this paper, even though I find that I am contradicting myself every five lines. I wish to verify the working of the natural logic of my ideas tomorrow during the reading\u2014whether I am capable of detecting logical errors, and whether all that I have meditated over during the last six months be true, or nothing but delirium.",
            "\u201cIf two months since I had been called upon to leave my room and the view of Meyer\u2019s wall opposite, I verily believe I should have been sorry. But now I have no such feeling, and yet I am leaving this room and Meyer\u2019s brick wall _for ever_. So that my conclusion, that it is not worth while indulging in grief, or any other emotion, for a fortnight, has proved stronger than my very nature, and has taken over the direction of my feelings. But is it so? Is it the case that my nature is conquered entirely? If I were to be put on the rack now, I should certainly cry out. I should not say that it is not worth while to yell and feel pain because I have but a fortnight to live.",
            "\u201cBut is it true that I have but a fortnight of life left to me? I know I told some of my friends that Doctor B. had informed me that this was the case; but I now confess that I lied; B. has not even seen me. However, a week ago, I called in a medical student, Kislorodoff, who is a Nationalist, an Atheist, and a Nihilist, by conviction, and that is why I had him. I needed a man who would tell me the bare truth without any humbug or ceremony\u2014and so he did\u2014indeed, almost with pleasure (which I thought was going a little too far).",
            "\u201cWell, he plumped out that I had about a month left me; it might be a little more, he said, under favourable circumstances, but it might also be considerably less. According to his opinion I might die quite suddenly\u2014tomorrow, for instance\u2014there had been such cases. Only a day or two since a young lady at Colomna who suffered from consumption, and was about on a par with myself in the march of the disease, was going out to market to buy provisions, when she suddenly felt faint, lay down on the sofa, gasped once, and died.",
            "\u201cKislorodoff told me all this with a sort of exaggerated devil-may-care negligence, and as though he did me great honour by talking to me so, because it showed that he considered me the same sort of exalted Nihilistic being as himself, to whom death was a matter of no consequence whatever, either way.",
            "\u201cAt all events, the fact remained\u2014a month of life and no more! That he is right in his estimation I am absolutely persuaded.",
            "\u201cIt puzzles me much to think how on earth the prince guessed yesterday that I have had bad dreams. He said to me, \u2018Your excitement and dreams will find relief at Pavlofsk.\u2019 Why did he say \u2018dreams\u2019? Either he is a doctor, or else he is a man of exceptional intelligence and wonderful powers of observation. (But that he is an \u2018idiot,\u2019 at bottom there can be no doubt whatever.) It so happened that just before he arrived I had a delightful little dream; one of a kind that I have hundreds of just now. I had fallen asleep about an hour before he came in, and dreamed that I was in some room, not my own. It was a large room, well furnished, with a cupboard, chest of drawers, sofa, and my bed, a fine wide bed covered with a silken counterpane. But I observed in the room a dreadful-looking creature, a sort of monster. It was a little like a scorpion, but was not a scorpion, but far more horrible, and especially so, because there are no creatures anything like it in nature, and because it had appeared to me for a purpose, and bore some mysterious signification. I looked at the beast well; it was brown in colour and had a shell; it was a crawling kind of reptile, about eight inches long, and narrowed down from the head, which was about a couple of fingers in width, to the end of the tail, which came to a fine point. Out of its trunk, about a couple of inches below its head, came two legs at an angle of forty-five degrees, each about three inches long, so that the beast looked like a trident from above. It had eight hard needle-like whiskers coming out from different parts of its body; it went along like a snake, bending its body about in spite of the shell it wore, and its motion was very quick and very horrible to look at. I was dreadfully afraid it would sting me; somebody had told me, I thought, that it was venomous; but what tormented me most of all was the wondering and wondering as to who had sent it into my room, and what was the mystery which I felt it contained.",
            "\u201cIt hid itself under the cupboard and under the chest of drawers, and crawled into the corners. I sat on a chair and kept my legs tucked under me. Then the beast crawled quietly across the room and disappeared somewhere near my chair. I looked about for it in terror, but I still hoped that as my feet were safely tucked away it would not be able to touch me.",
            "\u201cSuddenly I heard behind me, and about on a level with my head, a sort of rattling sound. I turned sharp round and saw that the brute had crawled up the wall as high as the level of my face, and that its horrible tail, which was moving incredibly fast from side to side, was actually touching my hair! I jumped up\u2014and it disappeared. I did not dare lie down on my bed for fear it should creep under my pillow. My mother came into the room, and some friends of hers. They began to hunt for the reptile and were more composed than I was; they did not seem to be afraid of it. But they did not understand as I did.",
            "\u201cSuddenly the monster reappeared; it crawled slowly across the room and made for the door, as though with some fixed intention, and with a slow movement that was more horrible than ever.",
            "\u201cThen my mother opened the door and called my dog, Norma. Norma was a great Newfoundland, and died five years ago.",
            "\u201cShe sprang forward and stood still in front of the reptile as if she had been turned to stone. The beast stopped too, but its tail and claws still moved about. I believe animals are incapable of feeling supernatural fright\u2014if I have been rightly informed,\u2014but at this moment there appeared to me to be something more than ordinary about Norma\u2019s terror, as though it must be supernatural; and as though she felt, just as I did myself, that this reptile was connected with some mysterious secret, some fatal omen.",
            "\u201cNorma backed slowly and carefully away from the brute, which followed her, creeping deliberately after her as though it intended to make a sudden dart and sting her.",
            "\u201cIn spite of Norma\u2019s terror she looked furious, though she trembled in all her limbs. At length she slowly bared her terrible teeth, opened her great red jaws, hesitated\u2014took courage, and seized the beast in her mouth. It seemed to try to dart out of her jaws twice, but Norma caught at it and half swallowed it as it was escaping. The shell cracked in her teeth; and the tail and legs stuck out of her mouth and shook about in a horrible manner. Suddenly Norma gave a piteous whine; the reptile had bitten her tongue. She opened her mouth wide with the pain, and I saw the beast lying across her tongue, and out of its body, which was almost bitten in two, came a hideous white-looking substance, oozing out into Norma\u2019s mouth; it was of the consistency of a crushed black-beetle. Just then I awoke and the prince entered the room.\u201d",
            "\u201cGentlemen!\u201d said Hippolyte, breaking off here, \u201cI have not done yet, but it seems to me that I have written down a great deal here that is unnecessary,\u2014this dream\u2014\u201d",

            "\u201cHow can I? How can I?\u201d cried Hippolyte, looking at him in amazement. \u201cGentlemen! I was a fool! I won\u2019t break off again. Listen, everyone who wants to!\u201d",
            "He gulped down some water out of a glass standing near, bent over the table, in order to hide his face from the audience, and recommenced.",
            "\u201cThe idea that it is not worth while living for a few weeks took possession of me a month ago, when I was told that I had four weeks to live, but only partially so at that time. The idea quite overmastered me three days since, that evening at Pavlofsk. The first time that I felt really impressed with this thought was on the terrace at the prince\u2019s, at the very moment when I had taken it into my head to make a last trial of life. I wanted to see people and trees (I believe I said so myself), I got excited, I maintained Burdovsky\u2019s rights, \u2018my neighbour!\u2019\u2014I dreamt that one and all would open their arms, and embrace me, that there would be an indescribable exchange of forgiveness between us all! In a word, I behaved like a fool, and then, at that very same instant, I felt my \u2018last conviction.\u2019 I ask myself now how I could have waited six months for that conviction! I knew that I had a disease that spares no one, and I really had no illusions; but the more I realized my condition, the more I clung to life; I wanted to live at any price. I confess I might well have resented that blind, deaf fate, which, with no apparent reason, seemed to have decided to crush me like a fly; but why did I not stop at resentment? Why did I begin to live, knowing that it was not worthwhile to begin? Why did I attempt to do what I knew to be an impossibility? And yet I could not even read a book to the end; I had given up reading. What is the good of reading, what is the good of learning anything, for just six months? That thought has made me throw aside a book more than once.",
            "\u201cYes, that wall of Meyer\u2019s could tell a tale if it liked. There was no spot on its dirty surface that I did not know by heart. Accursed wall! and yet it is dearer to me than all the Pavlofsk trees!\u2014That is\u2014it _would_ be dearer if it were not all the same to me, now!",
            "\u201cI remember now with what hungry interest I began to watch the lives of other people\u2014interest that I had never felt before! I used to wait for Colia\u2019s arrival impatiently, for I was so ill myself, then, that I could not leave the house. I so threw myself into every little detail of news, and took so much interest in every report and rumour, that I believe I became a regular gossip! I could not understand, among other things, how all these people\u2014with so much life in and before them\u2014do not become _rich_\u2014and I don\u2019t understand it now. I remember being told of a poor wretch I once knew, who had died of hunger. I was almost beside myself with rage! I believe if I could have resuscitated him I would have done so for the sole purpose of murdering him!",
            "\u201cOccasionally I was so much better that I could go out; but the streets used to put me in such a rage that I would lock myself up for days rather than go out, even if I were well enough to do so! I could not bear to see all those preoccupied, anxious-looking creatures continuously surging along the streets past me! Why are they always anxious? What is the meaning of their eternal care and worry? It is their wickedness, their perpetual detestable malice\u2014that\u2019s what it is\u2014they are all full of malice, malice!",
            "\u201cWhose fault is it that they are all miserable, that they don\u2019t know how to live, though they have fifty or sixty years of life before them? Why did that fool allow himself to die of hunger with sixty years of unlived life before him?",

And side by side with them trots along some wretched fellow who has known better days, doing light porter\u2019s work from morn to night for a living, always blubbering and saying that \u2018his wife died because he had no money to buy medicine with,\u2019 and his children dying of cold and hunger, and his eldest daughter gone to the bad, and so on. Oh! I have no pity and no patience for these fools of people. Why can\u2019t they be Rothschilds? Whose fault is it that a man has not got millions of money like Rothschild?

Well, let them laugh, and say it is all nonsense, if they please. They may say it is all fairy-tales, if they like; and I have spent whole nights telling myself fairy-tales. I remember them all. But how can I tell fairy-tales now? The time for them is over. They amused me when I found that there was not even time for me to learn the Greek grammar, as I wanted to do. \u2018I shall die before I get to the syntax,\u2019 I thought at the first page\u2014and threw the book under the table.

Well, I affirm that my reader is wrong again, for my convictions have nothing to do with my sentence of death. Ask them, ask any one of them, or all of them, what they mean by happiness! Oh, you may be perfectly sure that if Columbus was happy, it was not after he had discovered America, but when he was discovering it! You may be quite sure that he reached the culminating point of his happiness three days before he saw the New World with his actual eyes, when his mutinous sailors wanted to tack about, and return to Europe! What did the New World matter after all? Columbus had hardly seen it when he died, and in reality he was entirely ignorant of what he had discovered.

            "\u201cA word as to my circumstances. When, eight months since, I became very ill, I threw up all my old connections and dropped all my old companions. As I was always a gloomy, morose sort of individual, my friends easily forgot me; of course, they would have forgotten me all the same, without that excuse. My position at home was solitary enough. Five months ago I separated myself entirely from the family, and no one dared enter my room except at stated times, to clean and tidy it, and so on, and to bring me my meals. My mother dared not disobey me; she kept the children quiet, for my sake, and beat them if they dared to make any noise and disturb me. I so often complained of them that I should think they must be very fond, indeed, of me by this time. I think I must have tormented \u2018my faithful Colia\u2019 (as I called him) a good deal too. He tormented me of late; I could see that he always bore my tempers as though he had determined to \u2018spare the poor invalid.\u2019 This annoyed me, naturally. He seemed to have taken it into his head to imitate the prince in Christian meekness! Surikoff, who lived above us, annoyed me, too. He was so miserably poor, and I used to prove to him that he had no one to blame but himself for his poverty. I used to be so angry that I think I frightened him eventually, for he stopped coming to see me. He was a most meek and humble fellow, was Surikoff. (N.B.\u2014They say that meekness is a great power. I must ask the prince about this, for the expression is his.) But I remember one day in March, when I went up to his lodgings to see whether it was true that one of his children had been starved and frozen to death, I began to hold forth to him about his poverty being his own fault, and, in the course of my remarks, I accidentally smiled at the corpse of his child. Well, the poor wretch\u2019s lips began to tremble, and he caught me by the shoulder, and pushed me to the door. \u2018Go out,\u2019 he said, in a whisper. I went out, of course, and I declare I _liked_ it. I liked it at the very moment when I was turned out. But his words filled me with a strange sort of feeling of disdainful pity for him whenever I thought of them\u2014a feeling which I did not in the least desire to entertain. At the very moment of the insult (for I admit that I did insult him, though I did not mean to), this man could not lose his temper. His lips had trembled, but I swear it was not with rage. He had taken me by the arm, and said, \u2018Go out,\u2019 without the least anger. There was dignity, a great deal of dignity, about him, and it was so inconsistent with the look of him that, I assure you, it was quite comical. But there was no anger. Perhaps he merely began to despise me at that moment.",
            "\u201cSince that time he has always taken off his hat to me on the stairs, whenever I met him, which is a thing he never did before; but he always gets away from me as quickly as he can, as though he felt confused. If he did despise me, he despised me \u2018meekly,\u2019 after his own fashion.",
            "\u201cI dare say he only took his hat off out of fear, as it were, to the son of his creditor; for he always owed my mother money. I thought of having an explanation with him, but I knew that if I did, he would begin to apologize in a minute or two, so I decided to let him alone.",
            "\u201cJust about that time, that is, the middle of March, I suddenly felt very much better; this continued for a couple of weeks. I used to go out at dusk. I like the dusk, especially in March, when the night frost begins to harden the day\u2019s puddles, and the gas is burning.",
            "\u201cWell, one night in the Shestilavochnaya, a man passed me with a paper parcel under his arm. I did not take stock of him very carefully, but he seemed to be dressed in some shabby summer dust-coat, much too light for the season. When he was opposite the lamp-post, some ten yards away, I observed something fall out of his pocket. I hurried forward to pick it up, just in time, for an old wretch in a long kaftan rushed up too. He did not dispute the matter, but glanced at what was in my hand and disappeared.",
            "\u201cIt was a large old-fashioned pocket-book, stuffed full; but I guessed, at a glance, that it had anything in the world inside it, except money.",
            "\u201cThe owner was now some forty yards ahead of me, and was very soon lost in the crowd. I ran after him, and began calling out; but as I knew nothing to say excepting \u2018hey!\u2019 he did not turn round. Suddenly he turned into the gate of a house to the left; and when I darted in after him, the gateway was so dark that I could see nothing whatever. It was one of those large houses built in small tenements, of which there must have been at least a hundred.",
            "\u201cWhen I entered the yard I thought I saw a man going along on the far side of it; but it was so dark I could not make out his figure.",
            "\u201cI crossed to that corner and found a dirty dark staircase. I heard a man mounting up above me, some way higher than I was, and thinking I should catch him before his door would be opened to him, I rushed after him. I heard a door open and shut on the fifth storey, as I panted along; the stairs were narrow, and the steps innumerable, but at last I reached the door I thought the right one. Some moments passed before I found the bell and got it to ring.",
            "\u201cAn old peasant woman opened the door; she was busy lighting the \u2018samovar\u2019 in a tiny kitchen. She listened silently to my questions, did not understand a word, of course, and opened another door leading into a little bit of a room, low and scarcely furnished at all, but with a large, wide bed in it, hung with curtains. On this bed lay one Terentich, as the woman called him, drunk, it appeared to me. On the table was an end of candle in an iron candlestick, and a half-bottle of vodka, nearly finished. Terentich muttered something to me, and signed towards the next room. The old woman had disappeared, so there was nothing for me to do but to open the door indicated. I did so, and entered the next room.",
            "\u201cThis was still smaller than the other, so cramped that I could scarcely turn round; a narrow single bed at one side took up nearly all the room. Besides the bed there were only three common chairs, and a wretched old kitchen-table standing before a small sofa. One could hardly squeeze through between the table and the bed.",
            "\u201cOn the table, as in the other room, burned a tallow candle-end in an iron candlestick; and on the bed there whined a baby of scarcely three weeks old. A pale-looking woman was dressing the child, probably the mother; she looked as though she had not as yet got over the trouble of childbirth, she seemed so weak and was so carelessly dressed. Another child, a little girl of about three years old, lay on the sofa, covered over with what looked like a man\u2019s old dress-coat.",
            "\u201cAt the table stood a man in his shirt sleeves; he had thrown off his coat; it lay upon the bed; and he was unfolding a blue paper parcel in which were a couple of pounds of bread, and some little sausages.",
            "\u201cOn the table along with these things were a few old bits of black bread, and some tea in a pot. From under the bed there protruded an open portmanteau full of bundles of rags. In a word, the confusion and untidiness of the room were indescribable.",
            "\u201cIt appeared to me, at the first glance, that both the man and the woman were respectable people, but brought to that pitch of poverty where untidiness seems to get the better of every effort to cope with it, till at last they take a sort of bitter satisfaction in it. When I entered the room, the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and was still unpacking his parcels, was saying something to his wife in an excited manner. The news was apparently bad, as usual, for the woman began whimpering. The man\u2019s face seemed to me to be refined and even pleasant. He was dark-complexioned, and about twenty-eight years of age; he wore black whiskers, and his lip and chin were shaved. He looked morose, but with a sort of pride of expression. A curious scene followed.",
            "\u201cThere are people who find satisfaction in their own touchy feelings, especially when they have just taken the deepest offence; at such moments they feel that they would rather be offended than not. These easily-ignited natures, if they are wise, are always full of remorse afterwards, when they reflect that they have been ten times as angry as they need have been.",
            "\u201cThe gentleman before me gazed at me for some seconds in amazement, and his wife in terror; as though there was something alarmingly extraordinary in the fact that anyone could come to see them. But suddenly he fell upon me almost with fury; I had had no time to mutter more than a couple of words; but he had doubtless observed that I was decently dressed and, therefore, took deep offence because I had dared enter his den so unceremoniously, and spy out the squalor and untidiness of it.",
            "\u201cOf course he was delighted to get hold of someone upon whom to vent his rage against things in general.",
            "\u201cFor a moment I thought he would assault me; he grew so pale that he looked like a woman about to have hysterics; his wife was dreadfully alarmed.",
            "\u201c\u2018How dare you come in so? Be off!\u2019 he shouted, trembling all over with rage and scarcely able to articulate the words. Suddenly, however, he observed his pocketbook in my hand.",
            "\u201c\u2018I think you dropped this,\u2019 I remarked, as quietly and drily as I could. (I thought it best to treat him so.) For some while he stood before me in downright terror, and seemed unable to understand. He then suddenly grabbed at his side-pocket, opened his mouth in alarm, and beat his forehead with his hand.",
            "\u201c\u2018My God!\u2019 he cried, \u2018where did you find it? How?\u2019 I explained in as few words as I could, and as drily as possible, how I had seen it and picked it up; how I had run after him, and called out to him, and how I had followed him upstairs and groped my way to his door.",
            "\u201c\u2018Gracious Heaven!\u2019 he cried, \u2018all our papers are in it! My dear sir, you little know what you have done for us. I should have been lost\u2014lost!\u2019",
            "\u201cI had taken hold of the door-handle meanwhile, intending to leave the room without reply; but I was panting with my run upstairs, and my exhaustion came to a climax in a violent fit of coughing, so bad that I could hardly stand.",
            "\u201cI saw how the man dashed about the room to find me an empty chair, how he kicked the rags off a chair which was covered up by them, brought it to me, and helped me to sit down; but my cough went on for another three minutes or so. When I came to myself he was sitting by me on another chair, which he had also cleared of the rubbish by throwing it all over the floor, and was watching me intently.",
            "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m afraid you are ill?\u2019 he remarked, in the tone which doctors use when they address a patient. \u2018I am myself a medical man\u2019 (he did not say \u2018doctor\u2019), with which words he waved his hands towards the room and its contents as though in protest at his present condition. \u2018I see that you\u2014\u2019",
            "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m in consumption,\u2019 I said laconically, rising from my seat.",
            "\u201cHe jumped up, too.",
            "\u201c\u2018Perhaps you are exaggerating\u2014if you were to take proper measures perhaps\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cHe was terribly confused and did not seem able to collect his scattered senses; the pocket-book was still in his left hand.",
            "\u201c\u2018Oh, don\u2019t mind me,\u2019 I said. \u2018Dr. B\u2014\u2014 saw me last week\u2019 (I lugged him in again), \u2018and my hash is quite settled; pardon me\u2014\u2019 I took hold of the door-handle again. I was on the point of opening the door and leaving my grateful but confused medical friend to himself and his shame, when my damnable cough got hold of me again.",
            "\u201cMy doctor insisted on my sitting down again to get my breath. He now said something to his wife who, without leaving her place, addressed a few words of gratitude and courtesy to me. She seemed very shy over it, and her sickly face flushed up with confusion. I remained, but with the air of a man who knows he is intruding and is anxious to get away. The doctor\u2019s remorse at last seemed to need a vent, I could see.",
            "\u201c\u2018If I\u2014\u2019 he began, breaking off abruptly every other moment, and starting another sentence. \u2018I\u2014I am so very grateful to you, and I am so much to blame in your eyes, I feel sure, I\u2014you see\u2014\u2019 (he pointed to the room again) \u2018at this moment I am in such a position\u2014\u2019",
            "\u201c\u2018Oh!\u2019 I said, \u2018there\u2019s nothing to see; it\u2019s quite a clear case\u2014you\u2019ve lost your post and have come up to make explanations and get another, if you can!\u2019",
            "\u201c\u2018How do you know that?\u2019 he asked in amazement.",
            "\u201c\u2018Oh, it was evident at the first glance,\u2019 I said ironically, but not intentionally so. \u2018There are lots of people who come up from the provinces full of hope, and run about town, and have to live as best they can.\u2019",
            "\u201cHe began to talk at once excitedly and with trembling lips; he began complaining and telling me his story. He interested me, I confess; I sat there nearly an hour. His story was a very ordinary one. He had been a provincial doctor; he had a civil appointment, and had no sooner taken it up than intrigues began. Even his wife was dragged into these. He was proud, and flew into a passion; there was a change of local government which acted in favour of his opponents; his position was undermined, complaints were made against him; he lost his post and came up to Petersburg with his last remaining money, in order to appeal to higher authorities. Of course nobody would listen to him for a long time; he would come and tell his story one day and be refused promptly; another day he would be fed on false promises; again he would be treated harshly; then he would be told to sign some documents; then he would sign the paper and hand it in, and they would refuse to receive it, and tell him to file a formal petition. In a word he had been driven about from office to office for five months and had spent every farthing he had; his wife\u2019s last rags had just been pawned; and meanwhile a child had been born to them and\u2014and today I have a final refusal to my petition, and I have hardly a crumb of bread left\u2014I have nothing left; my wife has had a baby lately\u2014and I\u2014I\u2014\u2019",
            "\u201cHe sprang up from his chair and turned away. His wife was crying in the corner; the child had begun to moan again. I pulled out my note-book and began writing in it. When I had finished and rose from my chair he was standing before me with an expression of alarmed curiosity.",
            "\u201c\u2018I have jotted down your name,\u2019 I told him, \u2018and all the rest of it\u2014the place you served at, the district, the date, and all. I have a friend, Bachmatoff, whose uncle is a councillor of state and has to do with these matters, one Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff.\u2019",
            "\u201c\u2018Peter Matveyevitch Bachmatoff!\u2019 he cried, trembling all over with excitement. \u2018Why, nearly everything depends on that very man!\u2019",
            "\u201cIt is very curious, this story of the medical man, and my visit, and the happy termination to which I contributed by accident! Everything fitted in, as in a novel. I told the poor people not to put much hope in me, because I was but a poor schoolboy myself\u2014(I am not really, but I humiliated myself as much as possible in order to make them less hopeful)\u2014but that I would go at once to the Vassili Ostroff and see my friend; and that as I knew for certain that his uncle adored him, and was absolutely devoted to him as the last hope and branch of the family, perhaps the old man might do something to oblige his nephew.",
            "\u201c\u2018If only they would allow me to explain all to his excellency! If I could but be permitted to tell my tale to him!\u201d he cried, trembling with feverish agitation, and his eyes flashing with excitement. I repeated once more that I could not hold out much hope\u2014that it would probably end in smoke, and if I did not turn up next morning they must make up their minds that there was no more to be done in the matter.",
            "\u201cThey showed me out with bows and every kind of respect; they seemed quite beside themselves. I shall never forget the expression of their faces!",
            "\u201cI took a droshky and drove over to the Vassili Ostroff at once. For some years I had been at enmity with this young Bachmatoff, at school. We considered him an aristocrat; at all events I called him one. He used to dress smartly, and always drove to school in a private trap. He was a good companion, and was always merry and jolly, sometimes even witty, though he was not very intellectual, in spite of the fact that he was always top of the class; I myself was never top in anything! All his companions were very fond of him, excepting myself. He had several times during those years come up to me and tried to make friends; but I had always turned sulkily away and refused to have anything to do with him. I had not seen him for a whole year now; he was at the university. When, at nine o\u2019clock, or so, this evening, I arrived and was shown up to him with great ceremony, he first received me with astonishment, and not too affably, but he soon cheered up, and suddenly gazed intently at me and burst out laughing.",
            "\u201c\u2018Why, what on earth can have possessed you to come and see _me_, Terentieff?\u2019 he cried, with his usual pleasant, sometimes audacious, but never offensive familiarity, which I liked in reality, but for which I also detested him. \u2018Why what\u2019s the matter?\u2019 he cried in alarm. \u2018Are you ill?\u2019",
            "\u201cThat confounded cough of mine had come on again; I fell into a chair, and with difficulty recovered my breath. \u2018It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s only consumption\u2019 I said. \u2018I have come to you with a petition!\u2019",
            "\u201cHe sat down in amazement, and I lost no time in telling him the medical man\u2019s history; and explained that he, with the influence which he possessed over his uncle, might do some good to the poor fellow.",
            "\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll do it\u2014I\u2019ll do it, of course!\u2019 he said. \u2018I shall attack my uncle about it tomorrow morning, and I\u2019m very glad you told me the story. But how was it that you thought of coming to me about it, Terentieff?\u2019",
            "\u201c\u2018So much depends upon your uncle,\u2019 I said. \u2018And besides we have always been enemies, Bachmatoff; and as you are a generous sort of fellow, I thought you would not refuse my request because I was your enemy!\u2019 I added with irony.",
            "\u201c\u2018Like Napoleon going to England, eh?\u2019 cried he, laughing. \u2018I\u2019ll do it though\u2014of course, and at once, if I can!\u2019 he added, seeing that I rose seriously from my chair at this point.",
            "\u201cAnd sure enough the matter ended as satisfactorily as possible. A month or so later my medical friend was appointed to another post. He got his travelling expenses paid, and something to help him to start life with once more. I think Bachmatoff must have persuaded the doctor to accept a loan from himself. I saw Bachmatoff two or three times, about this period, the third time being when he gave a farewell dinner to the doctor and his wife before their departure, a champagne dinner.",
            "\u201cBachmatoff saw me home after the dinner and we crossed the Nicolai bridge. We were both a little drunk. He told me of his joy, the joyful feeling of having done a good action; he said that it was all thanks to myself that he could feel this satisfaction; and held forth about the foolishness of the theory that individual charity is useless.",
            "\u201cI, too, was burning to have my say!",
            "\u201c\u2018In Moscow,\u2019 I said, \u2018there was an old state counsellor, a civil general, who, all his life, had been in the habit of visiting the prisons and speaking to criminals. Every party of convicts on its way to Siberia knew beforehand that on the Vorobeef Hills the \u201cold general\u201d would pay them a visit. He did all he undertook seriously and devotedly. He would walk down the rows of the unfortunate prisoners, stop before each individual and ask after his needs\u2014he never sermonized them; he spoke kindly to them\u2014he gave them money; he brought them all sorts of necessaries for the journey, and gave them devotional books, choosing those who could read, under the firm conviction that they would read to those who could not, as they went along.",
            "\u201c\u2018He scarcely ever talked about the particular crimes of any of them, but listened if any volunteered information on that point. All the convicts were equal for him, and he made no distinction. He spoke to all as to brothers, and every one of them looked upon him as a father. When he observed among the exiles some poor woman with a child, he would always come forward and fondle the little one, and make it laugh. He continued these acts of mercy up to his very death; and by that time all the criminals, all over Russia and Siberia, knew him!",
            "\u201c\u2018A man I knew who had been to Siberia and returned, told me that he himself had been a witness of how the very most hardened criminals remembered the old general, though, in point of fact, he could never, of course, have distributed more than a few pence to each member of a party. Their recollection of him was not sentimental or particularly devoted. Some wretch, for instance, who had been a murderer\u2014cutting the throat of a dozen fellow-creatures, for instance; or stabbing six little children for his own amusement (there have been such men!)\u2014would perhaps, without rhyme or reason, suddenly give a sigh and say, \u201cI wonder whether that old general is alive still!\u201d Although perhaps he had not thought of mentioning him for a dozen years before! How can one say what seed of good may have been dropped into his soul, never to die?\u2019",
            "\u201cI continued in that strain for a long while, pointing out to Bachmatoff how impossible it is to follow up the effects of any isolated good deed one may do, in all its influences and subtle workings upon the heart and after-actions of others.",
            "\u201c\u2018And to think that you are to be cut off from life!\u2019 remarked Bachmatoff, in a tone of reproach, as though he would like to find someone to pitch into on my account.",
            "\u201cWe were leaning over the balustrade of the bridge, looking into the Neva at this moment.",
            "\u201c\u2018Do you know what has suddenly come into my head?\u2019 said I, suddenly\u2014leaning further and further over the rail.",
            "\u201c\u2018Surely not to throw yourself into the river?\u2019 cried Bachmatoff in alarm. Perhaps he read my thought in my face.",
            "\u201c\u2018No, not yet. At present nothing but the following consideration. You see I have some two or three months left me to live\u2014perhaps four; well, supposing that when I have but a month or two more, I take a fancy for some \u201cgood deed\u201d that needs both trouble and time, like this business of our doctor friend, for instance: why, I shall have to give up the idea of it and take to something else\u2014some _little_ good deed, _more within my means_, eh? Isn\u2019t that an amusing idea!\u2019",
            "\u201cPoor Bachmatoff was much impressed\u2014painfully so. He took me all the way home; not attempting to console me, but behaving with the greatest delicacy. On taking leave he pressed my hand warmly and asked permission to come and see me. I replied that if he came to me as a \u2018comforter,\u2019 so to speak (for he would be in that capacity whether he spoke to me in a soothing manner or only kept silence, as I pointed out to him), he would but remind me each time of my approaching death! He shrugged his shoulders, but quite agreed with me; and we parted better friends than I had expected.",
            "\u201cBut that evening and that night were sown the first seeds of my \u2018last conviction.\u2019 I seized greedily on my new idea; I thirstily drank in all its different aspects (I did not sleep a wink that night!), and the deeper I went into it the more my being seemed to merge itself in it, and the more alarmed I became. A dreadful terror came over me at last, and did not leave me all next day.",
            "\u201cSometimes, thinking over this, I became quite numb with the terror of it; and I might well have deduced from this fact, that my \u2018last conviction\u2019 was eating into my being too fast and too seriously, and would undoubtedly come to its climax before long. And for the climax I needed greater determination than I yet possessed.",

Of course, it is all the same to me, but just now\u2014and perhaps only at this moment\u2014I desire that all those who are to judge of my action should see clearly out of how logical a sequence of deductions has at length proceeded my \u2018last conviction.\u2019",
            "\u201cI have said above that the determination needed by me for the accomplishment of my final resolve, came to hand not through any sequence of causes, but thanks to a certain strange circumstance which had perhaps no connection whatever with the matter at issue. Ten days ago Rogojin called upon me about certain business of his own with which I have nothing to do at present. I had never seen Rogojin before, but had often heard about him.",
            "\u201cI gave him all the information he needed, and he very soon took his departure; so that, since he only came for the purpose of gaining the information, the matter might have been expected to end there.",
            "\u201cBut he interested me too much, and all that day I was under the influence of strange thoughts connected with him, and I determined to return his visit the next day.",
            "\u201cRogojin was evidently by no means pleased to see me, and hinted, delicately, that he saw no reason why our acquaintance should continue. For all that, however, I spent a very interesting hour, and so, I dare say, did he. There was so great a contrast between us that I am sure we must both have felt it; anyhow, I felt it acutely. Here was I, with my days numbered, and he, a man in the full vigour of life, living in the present, without the slightest thought for \u2018final convictions,\u2019 or numbers, or days, or, in fact, for anything but that which-which\u2014well, which he was mad about, if he will excuse me the expression\u2014as a feeble author who cannot express his ideas properly.",
            "\u201cIn spite of his lack of amiability, I could not help seeing, in Rogojin a man of intellect and sense; and although, perhaps, there was little in the outside world which was of interest to him, still he was clearly a man with eyes to see.",
            "\u201cI hinted nothing to him about my \u2018final conviction,\u2019 but it appeared to me that he had guessed it from my words. He remained silent\u2014he is a terribly silent man. I remarked to him, as I rose to depart, that, in spite of the contrast and the wide differences between us two, les extremites se touchent (\u2018extremes meet,\u2019 as I explained to him in Russian); so that maybe he was not so far from my final conviction as appeared.",
            "\u201cHis only reply to this was a sour grimace. He rose and looked for my cap, and placed it in my hand, and led me out of the house\u2014that dreadful gloomy house of his\u2014to all appearances, of course, as though I were leaving of my own accord, and he were simply seeing me to the door out of politeness. His house impressed me much; it is like a burial-ground, he seems to like it, which is, however, quite natural. Such a full life as he leads is so overflowing with absorbing interests that he has little need of assistance from his surroundings.",
            "\u201cThe visit to Rogojin exhausted me terribly. Besides, I had felt ill since the morning; and by evening I was so weak that I took to my bed, and was in high fever at intervals, and even delirious. Colia sat with me until eleven o\u2019clock.",
            "\u201cYet I remember all he talked about, and every word we said, though whenever my eyes closed for a moment I could picture nothing but the image of Surikoff just in the act of finding a million roubles. He could not make up his mind what to do with the money, and tore his hair over it. He trembled with fear that somebody would rob him, and at last he decided to bury it in the ground. I persuaded him that, instead of putting it all away uselessly underground, he had better melt it down and make a golden coffin out of it for his starved child, and then dig up the little one and put her into the golden coffin. Surikoff accepted this suggestion, I thought, with tears of gratitude, and immediately commenced to carry out my design.",
            "\u201cI thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust. Colia told me, when I quite recovered my senses, that I had not been asleep for a moment, but that I had spoken to him about Surikoff the whole while.",
            "\u201cAt moments I was in a state of dreadful weakness and misery, so that Colia was greatly disturbed when he left me.",
            "\u201cWhen I arose to lock the door after him, I suddenly called to mind a picture I had noticed at Rogojin\u2019s in one of his gloomiest rooms, over the door. He had pointed it out to me himself as we walked past it, and I believe I must have stood a good five minutes in front of it. There was nothing artistic about it, but the picture made me feel strangely uncomfortable. It represented Christ just taken down from the cross. It seems to me that painters as a rule represent the Saviour, both on the cross and taken down from it, with great beauty still upon His face. This marvellous beauty they strive to preserve even in His moments of deepest agony and passion. But there was no such beauty in Rogojin\u2019s picture. This was the presentment of a poor mangled body which had evidently suffered unbearable anguish even before its crucifixion, full of wounds and bruises, marks of the violence of soldiers and people, and of the bitterness of the moment when He had fallen with the cross\u2014all this combined with the anguish of the actual crucifixion.",
            "\u201cThe face was depicted as though still suffering; as though the body, only just dead, was still almost quivering with agony. The picture was one of pure nature, for the face was not beautified by the artist, but was left as it would naturally be, whosoever the sufferer, after such anguish.",
            "\u201cI know that the earliest Christian faith taught that the Saviour suffered actually and not figuratively, and that nature was allowed her own way even while His body was on the cross.",
            "\u201cIt is strange to look on this dreadful picture of the mangled corpse of the Saviour, and to put this question to oneself: \u2018Supposing that the disciples, the future apostles, the women who had followed Him and stood by the cross, all of whom believed in and worshipped Him\u2014supposing that they saw this tortured body, this face so mangled and bleeding and bruised (and they _must_ have so seen it)\u2014how could they have gazed upon the dreadful sight and yet have believed that He would rise again?\u2019",
            "\u201cThe thought steps in, whether one likes it or no, that death is so terrible and so powerful, that even He who conquered it in His miracles during life was unable to triumph over it at the last. He who called to Lazarus, \u2018Lazarus, come forth!\u2019 and the dead man lived\u2014He was now Himself a prey to nature and death. Nature appears to one, looking at this picture, as some huge, implacable, dumb monster; or still better\u2014a stranger simile\u2014some enormous mechanical engine of modern days which has seized and crushed and swallowed up a great and invaluable Being, a Being worth nature and all her laws, worth the whole earth, which was perhaps created merely for the sake of the advent of that Being.",
            "\u201cThis blind, dumb, implacable, eternal, unreasoning force is well shown in the picture, and the absolute subordination of all men and things to it is so well expressed that the idea unconsciously arises in the mind of anyone who looks at it. All those faithful people who were gazing at the cross and its mutilated occupant must have suffered agony of mind that evening; for they must have felt that all their hopes and almost all their faith had been shattered at a blow. They must have separated in terror and dread that night, though each perhaps carried away with him one great thought which was never eradicated from his mind for ever afterwards. If this great Teacher of theirs could have seen Himself after the Crucifixion, how could He have consented to mount the Cross and to die as He did? This thought also comes into the mind of the man who gazes at this picture. I thought of all this by snatches probably between my attacks of delirium\u2014for an hour and a half or so before Colia\u2019s departure.",
            "\u201cCan there be an appearance of that which has no form? And yet it seemed to me, at certain moments, that I beheld in some strange and impossible form, that dark, dumb, irresistibly powerful, eternal force.",
            "\u201cI thought someone led me by the hand and showed me, by the light of a candle, a huge, loathsome insect, which he assured me was that very force, that very almighty, dumb, irresistible Power, and laughed at the indignation with which I received this information. In my room they always light the little lamp before my icon for the night; it gives a feeble flicker of light, but it is strong enough to see by dimly, and if you sit just under it you can even read by it. I think it was about twelve or a little past that night. I had not slept a wink, and was lying with my eyes wide open, when suddenly the door opened, and in came Rogojin.",
            "\u201cHe entered, and shut the door behind him. Then he silently gazed at me and went quickly to the corner of the room where the lamp was burning and sat down underneath it.",
            "\u201cI was much surprised, and looked at him expectantly.",
            "\u201cRogojin only leaned his elbow on the table and silently stared at me. So passed two or three minutes, and I recollect that his silence hurt and offended me very much. Why did he not speak?",
            "\u201cThat his arrival at this time of night struck me as more or less strange may possibly be the case; but I remember I was by no means amazed at it. On the contrary, though I had not actually told him my thought in the morning, yet I know he understood it; and this thought was of such a character that it would not be anything very remarkable, if one were to come for further talk about it at any hour of night, however late.",
            "\u201cI thought he must have come for this purpose.",
            "\u201cIn the morning we had parted not the best of friends; I remember he looked at me with disagreeable sarcasm once or twice; and this same look I observed in his eyes now\u2014which was the cause of the annoyance I felt.",
            "\u201cI did not for a moment suspect that I was delirious and that this Rogojin was but the result of fever and excitement. I had not the slightest idea of such a theory at first.",
            "\u201cMeanwhile he continued to sit and stare jeeringly at me.",
            "\u201cI angrily turned round in bed and made up my mind that I would not say a word unless he did; so I rested silently on my pillow determined to remain dumb, if it were to last till morning. I felt resolved that he should speak first. Probably twenty minutes or so passed in this way. Suddenly the idea struck me\u2014what if this is an apparition and not Rogojin himself?",
            "\u201cNeither during my illness nor at any previous time had I ever seen an apparition;\u2014but I had always thought, both when I was a little boy, and even now, that if I were to see one I should die on the spot\u2014though I don\u2019t believe in ghosts. And yet _now_, when the idea struck me that this was a ghost and not Rogojin at all, I was not in the least alarmed. Nay\u2014the thought actually irritated me. Strangely enough, the decision of the question as to whether this were a ghost or Rogojin did not, for some reason or other, interest me nearly so much as it ought to have done;\u2014I think I began to muse about something altogether different. For instance, I began to wonder why Rogojin, who had been in dressing-gown and slippers when I saw him at home, had now put on a dress-coat and white waistcoat and tie? I also thought to myself, I remember\u2014\u2018if this is a ghost, and I am not afraid of it, why don\u2019t I approach it and verify my suspicions? Perhaps I am afraid\u2014\u2019 And no sooner did this last idea enter my head than an icy blast blew over me; I felt a chill down my backbone and my knees shook.",
            "\u201cAt this very moment, as though divining my thoughts, Rogojin raised his head from his arm and began to part his lips as though he were going to laugh\u2014but he continued to stare at me as persistently as before.",
            "\u201cI felt so furious with him at this moment that I longed to rush at him; but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie still\u2014and the more willingly, as I was still by no means satisfied as to whether it really was Rogojin or not.",
            "\u201cI cannot remember how long this lasted; I cannot recollect, either, whether consciousness forsook me at intervals, or not. But at last Rogojin rose, staring at me as intently as ever, but not smiling any longer,\u2014and walking very softly, almost on tip-toes, to the door, he opened it, went out, and shut it behind him.",
            "\u201cI did not rise from my bed, and I don\u2019t know how long I lay with my eyes open, thinking. I don\u2019t know what I thought about, nor how I fell asleep or became insensible; but I awoke next morning after nine o\u2019clock when they knocked at my door. My general orders are that if I don\u2019t open the door and call, by nine o\u2019clock, Matreona is to come and bring my tea. When I now opened the door to her, the thought suddenly struck me\u2014how could he have come in, since the door was locked? I made inquiries and found that Rogojin himself could not possibly have come in, because all our doors were locked for the night.",
            "\u201cWell, this strange circumstance\u2014which I have described with so much detail\u2014was the ultimate cause which led me to taking my final determination. So that no logic, or logical deductions, had anything to do with my resolve;\u2014it was simply a matter of disgust.",
            "\u201cIt was impossible for me to go on living when life was full of such detestable, strange, tormenting forms. This ghost had humiliated me;\u2014nor could I bear to be subordinate to that dark, horrible force which was embodied in the form of the loathsome insect. It was only towards evening, when I had quite made up my mind on this point, that I began to feel easier.\u201d "

            "\u201cQuite so, I see; because, you know, little mistakes have occurred now and then. There was a case\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy do you tease him?\u201d cried the prince, suddenly.",
            "\u201cYou\u2019ve moved him to tears,\u201d added Ferdishenko. But Hippolyte was by no means weeping. He was about to move from his place, when his four guards rushed at him and seized him once more. There was a laugh at this.",
            "\u201cHe led up to this on purpose. He took the trouble of writing all that so that people should come and grab him by the arm,\u201d observed Rogojin. \u201cGood-night, prince. What a time we\u2019ve sat here, my very bones ache!\u201d",
            "\u201cIf you really intended to shoot yourself, Terentieff,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, \u201cif I were you, after all these compliments, I should just not shoot myself in order to vex them all.\u201d",
            "\u201cThey are very anxious to see me blow my brains out,\u201d said Hippolyte, bitterly.",
            "\u201cYes, they\u2019ll be awfully annoyed if they don\u2019t see it.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen you think they won\u2019t see it?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am not trying to egg you on. On the contrary, I think it very likely that you may shoot yourself; but the principal thing is to keep cool,\u201d said Evgenie with a drawl, and with great condescension.",
            "\u201cI only now perceive what a terrible mistake I made in reading this article to them,\u201d said Hippolyte, suddenly, addressing Evgenie, and looking at him with an expression of trust and confidence, as though he were applying to a friend for counsel.",
            "\u201cYes, it\u2019s a droll situation; I really don\u2019t know what advice to give you,\u201d replied Evgenie, laughing. Hippolyte gazed steadfastly at him, but said nothing. To look at him one might have supposed that he was unconscious at intervals.",
            "\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said Lebedeff, \u201cbut did you observe the young gentleman\u2019s style? \u2018I\u2019ll go and blow my brains out in the park,\u2019 says he, \u2018so as not to disturb anyone.\u2019 He thinks he won\u2019t disturb anybody if he goes three yards away, into the park, and blows his brains out there.\u201d",
            "\u201cGentlemen\u2014\u201d began the prince.",
            "\u201cNo, no, excuse me, most revered prince,\u201d Lebedeff interrupted, excitedly. \u201cSince you must have observed yourself that this is no joke, and since at least half your guests must also have concluded that after all that has been said this youth _must_ blow his brains out for honour\u2019s sake\u2014I\u2014as master of this house, and before these witnesses, now call upon you to take steps.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, but what am I to do, Lebedeff? What steps am I to take? I am ready.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. In the first place he must immediately deliver up the pistol which he boasted of, with all its appurtenances. If he does this I shall consent to his being allowed to spend the night in this house\u2014considering his feeble state of health, and of course conditionally upon his being under proper supervision. But tomorrow he must go elsewhere. Excuse me, prince! Should he refuse to deliver up his weapon, then I shall instantly seize one of his arms and General Ivolgin the other, and we shall hold him until the police arrive and take the matter into their own hands. Mr. Ferdishenko will kindly fetch them.\u201d",
            "At this there was a dreadful noise; Lebedeff danced about in his excitement; Ferdishenko prepared to go for the police; Gania frantically insisted that it was all nonsense, \u201cfor nobody was going to shoot themselves.\u201d Evgenie Pavlovitch said nothing.",
            "\u201cPrince,\u201d whispered Hippolyte, suddenly, his eyes all ablaze, \u201cyou don\u2019t suppose that I did not foresee all this hatred?\u201d He looked at the prince as though he expected him to reply, for a moment. \u201cEnough!\u201d he added at length, and addressing the whole company, he cried: \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, gentlemen! Lebedeff, here\u2019s the key,\u201d (he took out a small bunch of keys); \u201cthis one, the last but one\u2014Colia will show you\u2014Colia, where\u2019s Colia?\u201d he cried, looking straight at Colia and not seeing him. \u201cYes, he\u2019ll show you; he packed the bag with me this morning. Take him up, Colia; my bag is upstairs in the prince\u2019s study, under the table. Here\u2019s the key, and in the little case you\u2019ll find my pistol and the powder, and all. Colia packed it himself, Mr. Lebedeff; he\u2019ll show you; but it\u2019s on condition that tomorrow morning, when I leave for Petersburg, you will give me back my pistol, do you hear? I do this for the prince\u2019s sake, not yours.\u201d",
            "\u201cCapital, that\u2019s much better!\u201d cried Lebedeff, and seizing the key he made off in haste.",
            "Colia stopped a moment as though he wished to say something; but Lebedeff dragged him away.",
            "Hippolyte looked around at the laughing guests. The prince observed that his teeth were chattering as though in a violent attack of ague.",
            "\u201cWhat brutes they all are!\u201d he whispered to the prince. Whenever he addressed him he lowered his voice.",
            "\u201cLet them alone, you\u2019re too weak now\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, directly; I\u2019ll go away directly. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d",
            "Suddenly he embraced Muishkin.",
            "\u201cPerhaps you think I am mad, eh?\u201d he asked him, laughing very strangely.",
            "\u201cNo, but you\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cDirectly, directly! Stand still a moment, I wish to look in your eyes; don\u2019t speak\u2014stand so\u2014let me look at you! I am bidding farewell to mankind.\u201d",
            "He stood so for ten seconds, gazing at the prince, motionless, deadly pale, his temples wet with perspiration; he held the prince\u2019s hand in a strange grip, as though afraid to let him go.",
            "\u201cHippolyte, Hippolyte, what is the matter with you?\u201d cried Muishkin.",
            "\u201cDirectly! There, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll lie down directly. I must drink to the sun\u2019s health. I wish to\u2014I insist upon it! Let go!\u201d",
            "He seized a glass from the table, broke away from the prince, and in a moment had reached the terrace steps.",
            "The prince made after him, but it so happened that at this moment Evgenie Pavlovitch stretched out his hand to say good-night. The next instant there was a general outcry, and then followed a few moments of indescribable excitement.",
            "Reaching the steps, Hippolyte had paused, holding the glass in his left hand while he put his right hand into his coat pocket.",
            "Keller insisted afterwards that he had held his right hand in his pocket all the while, when he was speaking to the prince, and that he had held the latter\u2019s shoulder with his left hand only. This circumstance, Keller affirmed, had led him to feel some suspicion from the first. However this may be, Keller ran after Hippolyte, but he was too late.",
            "He caught sight of something flashing in Hippolyte\u2019s right hand, and saw that it was a pistol. He rushed at him, but at that very instant Hippolyte raised the pistol to his temple and pulled the trigger. There followed a sharp metallic click, but no report.",
            "When Keller seized the would-be suicide, the latter fell forward into his arms, probably actually believing that he was shot. Keller had hold of the pistol now. Hippolyte was immediately placed in a chair, while the whole company thronged around excitedly, talking and asking each other questions. Every one of them had heard the snap of the trigger, and yet they saw a live and apparently unharmed man before them.",
            "Hippolyte himself sat quite unconscious of what was going on, and gazed around with a senseless expression.",
            "Lebedeff and Colia came rushing up at this moment.",
            "\u201cWhat is it?\u201d someone asked, breathlessly\u2014\u201cA misfire?\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps it wasn\u2019t loaded,\u201d said several voices.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s loaded all right,\u201d said Keller, examining the pistol, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat! did it miss fire?\u201d",
            "\u201cThere was no cap in it,\u201d Keller announced.",
            "It would be difficult to describe the pitiable scene that now followed. The first sensation of alarm soon gave place to amusement; some burst out laughing loud and heartily, and seemed to find a malicious satisfaction in the joke. Poor Hippolyte sobbed hysterically; he wrung his hands; he approached everyone in turn\u2014even Ferdishenko\u2014and took them by both hands, and swore solemnly that he had forgotten\u2014absolutely forgotten\u2014\u201caccidentally, and not on purpose,\u201d\u2014to put a cap in\u2014that he \u201chad ten of them, at least, in his pocket.\u201d He pulled them out and showed them to everyone; he protested that he had not liked to put one in beforehand for fear of an accidental explosion in his pocket. That he had thought he would have lots of time to put it in afterwards\u2014when required\u2014and, that, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten all about it. He threw himself upon the prince, then on Evgenie Pavlovitch. He entreated Keller to give him back the pistol, and he\u2019d soon show them all that \u201chis honour\u2014his honour,\u201d\u2014but he was \u201cdishonoured, now, for ever!\u201d",
            "He fell senseless at last\u2014and was carried into the prince\u2019s study.",
            "Lebedeff, now quite sobered down, sent for a doctor; and he and his daughter, with Burdovsky and General Ivolgin, remained by the sick man\u2019s couch.",
            "When he was carried away unconscious, Keller stood in the middle of the room, and made the following declaration to the company in general, in a loud tone of voice, with emphasis upon each word.",
            "\u201cGentlemen, if any one of you casts any doubt again, before me, upon Hippolyte\u2019s good faith, or hints that the cap was forgotten intentionally, or suggests that this unhappy boy was acting a part before us, I beg to announce that the person so speaking shall account to me for his words.\u201d",
            "No one replied.",
            "The company departed very quickly, in a mass. Ptitsin, Gania, and Rogojin went away together.",
            "The prince was much astonished that Evgenie Pavlovitch changed his mind, and took his departure without the conversation he had requested.",
            "\u201cWhy, you wished to have a talk with me when the others left?\u201d he said.",
            "\u201cQuite so,\u201d said Evgenie, sitting down suddenly beside him, \u201cbut I have changed my mind for the time being. I confess, I am too disturbed, and so, I think, are you; and the matter as to which I wished to consult you is too serious to tackle with one\u2019s mind even a little disturbed; too serious both for myself and for you. You see, prince, for once in my life I wish to perform an absolutely honest action, that is, an action with no ulterior motive; and I think I am hardly in a condition to talk of it just at this moment, and\u2014and\u2014well, we\u2019ll discuss it another time. Perhaps the matter may gain in clearness if we wait for two or three days\u2014just the two or three days which I must spend in Petersburg.\u201d",
            "Here he rose again from his chair, so that it seemed strange that he should have thought it worth while to sit down at all.",
            "The prince thought, too, that he looked vexed and annoyed, and not nearly so friendly towards himself as he had been earlier in the night.",
            "\u201cI suppose you will go to the sufferer\u2019s bedside now?\u201d he added.",
            "\u201cYes, I am afraid...\u201d began the prince.",
            "\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t fear! He\u2019ll live another six weeks all right. Very likely he will recover altogether; but I strongly advise you to pack him off tomorrow.\u201d",
            "\u201cI think I may have offended him by saying nothing just now. I am afraid he may suspect that I doubted his good faith,\u2014about shooting himself, you know. What do you think, Evgenie Pavlovitch?\u201d",
            "\u201cNot a bit of it! You are much too good to him; you shouldn\u2019t care a hang about what he thinks. I have heard of such things before, but never came across, till tonight, a man who would actually shoot himself in order to gain a vulgar notoriety, or blow out his brains for spite, if he finds that people don\u2019t care to pat him on the back for his sanguinary intentions. But what astonishes me more than anything is the fellow\u2019s candid confession of weakness. You\u2019d better get rid of him tomorrow, in any case.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you think he will make another attempt?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no, not he, not now! But you have to be very careful with this sort of gentleman. Crime is too often the last resource of these petty nonentities. This young fellow is quite capable of cutting the throats of ten people, simply for a lark, as he told us in his \u2018explanation.\u2019 I assure you those confounded words of his will not let me sleep.\u201d",
            "\u201cI think you disturb yourself too much.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat an extraordinary person you are, prince! Do you mean to say that you doubt the fact that he is capable of murdering ten men?\u201d",
            "\u201cI daren\u2019t say, one way or the other; all this is very strange\u2014but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, as you like, just as you like,\u201d said Evgenie Pavlovitch, irritably. \u201cOnly you are such a plucky fellow, take care you don\u2019t get included among the ten victims!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, he is much more likely not to kill anyone at all,\u201d said the prince, gazing thoughtfully at Evgenie. The latter laughed disagreeably.",
            "\u201cWell, _au revoir!_ Did you observe that he \u2018willed\u2019 a copy of his confession to Aglaya Ivanovna?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I did; I am thinking of it.\u201d",
            "\u201cIn connection with \u2018the ten,\u2019 eh?\u201d laughed Evgenie, as he left the room.",
            "An hour later, towards four o\u2019clock, the prince went into the park. He had endeavoured to fall asleep, but could not, owing to the painful beating of his heart.",
            "He had left things quiet and peaceful; the invalid was fast asleep, and the doctor, who had been called in, had stated that there was no special danger. Lebedeff, Colia, and Burdovsky were lying down in the sick-room, ready to take it in turns to watch. There was nothing to fear, therefore, at home.",
            "But the prince\u2019s mental perturbation increased every moment. He wandered about the park, looking absently around him, and paused in astonishment when he suddenly found himself in the empty space with the rows of chairs round it, near the Vauxhall. The look of the place struck him as dreadful now: so he turned round and went by the path which he had followed with the Epanchins on the way to the band, until he reached the green bench which Aglaya had pointed out for their rendezvous. He sat down on it and suddenly burst into a loud fit of laughter, immediately followed by a feeling of irritation. His disturbance of mind continued; he felt that he must go away somewhere, anywhere.",
            "Above his head some little bird sang out, of a sudden; he began to peer about for it among the leaves. Suddenly the bird darted out of the tree and away, and instantly he thought of the \u201cfly buzzing about in the sun\u2019s rays\u201d that Hippolyte had talked of; how that it knew its place and was a participator in the universal life, while he alone was an \u201coutcast.\u201d This picture had impressed him at the time, and he meditated upon it now. An old, forgotten memory awoke in his brain, and suddenly burst into clearness and light. It was a recollection of Switzerland, during the first year of his cure, the very first months. At that time he had been pretty nearly an idiot still; he could not speak properly, and had difficulty in understanding when others spoke to him. He climbed the mountain-side, one sunny morning, and wandered long and aimlessly with a certain thought in his brain, which would not become clear. Above him was the blazing sky, below, the lake; all around was the horizon, clear and infinite. He looked out upon this, long and anxiously. He remembered how he had stretched out his arms towards the beautiful, boundless blue of the horizon, and wept, and wept. What had so tormented him was the idea that he was a stranger to all this, that he was outside this glorious festival.",
            "What was this universe? What was this grand, eternal pageant to which he had yearned from his childhood up, and in which he could never take part? Every morning the same magnificent sun; every morning the same rainbow in the waterfall; every evening the same glow on the snow-mountains.",
            "Every little fly that buzzed in the sun\u2019s rays was a singer in the universal chorus, \u201cknew its place, and was happy in it.\u201d Every blade of grass grew and was happy. Everything knew its path and loved it, went forth with a song and returned with a song; only he knew nothing, understood nothing, neither men nor words, nor any of nature\u2019s voices; he was a stranger and an outcast.",
            "Oh, he could not then speak these words, or express all he felt! He had been tormented dumbly; but now it appeared to him that he must have said these very words\u2014even then\u2014and that Hippolyte must have taken his picture of the little fly from his tears and words of that time.",
            "He was sure of it, and his heart beat excitedly at the thought, he knew not why.",
            "He fell asleep on the bench; but his mental disquiet continued through his slumbers.",
            "Just before he dozed off, the idea of Hippolyte murdering ten men flitted through his brain, and he smiled at the absurdity of such a thought.",
            "Around him all was quiet; only the flutter and whisper of the leaves broke the silence, but broke it only to cause it to appear yet more deep and still.",
            "He dreamed many dreams as he sat there, and all were full of disquiet, so that he shuddered every moment.",
            "At length a woman seemed to approach him. He knew her, oh! he knew her only too well. He could always name her and recognize her anywhere; but, strange, she seemed to have quite a different face from hers, as he had known it, and he felt a tormenting desire to be able to say she was not the same woman. In the face before him there was such dreadful remorse and horror that he thought she must be a criminal, that she must have just committed some awful crime.",
            "Tears were trembling on her white cheek. She beckoned him, but placed her finger on her lip as though to warn him that he must follow her very quietly. His heart froze within him. He wouldn\u2019t, he _couldn\u2019t_ confess her to be a criminal, and yet he felt that something dreadful would happen the next moment, something which would blast his whole life.",
            "She seemed to wish to show him something, not far off, in the park.",
            "He rose from his seat in order to follow her, when a bright, clear peal of laughter rang out by his side. He felt somebody\u2019s hand suddenly in his own, seized it, pressed it hard, and awoke. Before him stood Aglaya, laughing aloud. "

            "\u201cOh, but he didn\u2019t kill himself; the pistol didn\u2019t go off.\u201d Aglaya insisted on hearing the whole story. She hurried the prince along, but interrupted him with all sorts of questions, nearly all of which were irrelevant. Among other things, she seemed greatly interested in every word that Evgenie Pavlovitch had said, and made the prince repeat that part of the story over and over again.",
            "\u201cWell, that\u2019ll do; we must be quick,\u201d she concluded, after hearing all. \u201cWe have only an hour here, till eight; I must be home by then without fail, so that they may not find out that I came and sat here with you; but I\u2019ve come on business. I have a great deal to say to you. But you have bowled me over considerably with your news. As to Hippolyte, I think his pistol was bound not to go off; it was more consistent with the whole affair. Are you sure he really wished to blow his brains out, and that there was no humbug about the matter?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo humbug at all.\u201d",

He will be delighted, you may be sure; for, in all probability, he shot at himself simply in order that I might read his confession.

            "She put her questions very quickly and talked fast, every now and then forgetting what she had begun to say, and not finishing her sentence. She seemed to be impatient to warn the prince about something or other. She was in a state of unusual excitement, and though she put on a brave and even defiant air, she seemed to be rather alarmed. She was dressed very simply, but this suited her well. She continually trembled and blushed, and she sat on the very edge of the seat.",

            "\u201cWell\u2014how am I to explain? He was very anxious that we should all come around him, and say we were so sorry for him, and that we loved him very much, and all that; and that we hoped he wouldn\u2019t kill himself, but remain alive. Very likely he thought more of you than the rest of us, because he mentioned you at such a moment, though perhaps he did not know himself that he had you in his mind\u2019s eye.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t understand you. How could he have me in view, and not be aware of it himself? And yet, I don\u2019t know\u2014perhaps I do. Do you know I have intended to poison myself at least thirty times\u2014ever since I was thirteen or so\u2014and to write to my parents before I did it? I used to think how nice it would be to lie in my coffin, and have them all weeping over me and saying it was all their fault for being so cruel, and all that\u2014what are you smiling at?\u201d she added, knitting her brow. \u201cWhat do _you_ think of when you go mooning about alone? I suppose you imagine yourself a field-marshal, and think you have conquered Napoleon?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I really have thought something of the sort now and then, especially when just dozing off,\u201d laughed the prince. \u201cOnly it is the Austrians whom I conquer\u2014not Napoleon.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t wish to joke with you, Lef Nicolaievitch. I shall see Hippolyte myself. Tell him so. As for you, I think you are behaving very badly, because it is not right to judge a man\u2019s soul as you are judging Hippolyte\u2019s. You have no gentleness, but only justice\u2014so you are unjust.\u201d",
            "The prince reflected.",
            "\u201cI think you are unfair towards me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nothing wrong in the thoughts I ascribe to Hippolyte; they are only natural. But of course I don\u2019t know for certain what he thought. Perhaps he thought nothing, but simply longed to see human faces once more, and to hear human praise and feel human affection. Who knows? Only it all came out wrong, somehow. Some people have luck, and everything comes out right with them; others have none, and never a thing turns out fortunately.\u201d",
            "\u201cI suppose you have felt that in your own case,\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cYes, I have,\u201d replied the prince, quite unsuspicious of any irony in the remark.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m\u2014well, at all events, I shouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep here, in your place. It wasn\u2019t nice of you, that. I suppose you fall asleep wherever you sit down?\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I didn\u2019t sleep a wink all night. I walked and walked about, and went to where the music was\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat music?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere they played last night. Then I found this bench and sat down, and thought and thought\u2014and at last I fell fast asleep.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, is that it? That makes a difference, perhaps. What did you go to the bandstand for?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cVery well\u2014afterwards. You are always interrupting me. What woman was it you were dreaming about?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt was\u2014about\u2014you saw her\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so; I understand. I understand quite well. You are very\u2014Well, how did she appear to you? What did she look like? No, I don\u2019t want to know anything about her,\u201d said Aglaya, angrily; \u201cdon\u2019t interrupt me\u2014\u201d",
            "She paused a moment as though getting breath, or trying to master her feeling of annoyance.",
            "\u201cLook here; this is what I called you here for. I wish to make you a\u2014to ask you to be my friend. What do you stare at me like that for?\u201d she added, almost angrily.",
            "The prince certainly had darted a rather piercing look at her, and now observed that she had begun to blush violently. At such moments, the more Aglaya blushed, the angrier she grew with herself; and this was clearly expressed in her eyes, which flashed like fire. As a rule, she vented her wrath on her unfortunate companion, be it who it might. She was very conscious of her own shyness, and was not nearly so talkative as her sisters for this reason\u2014in fact, at times she was much too quiet. When, therefore, she was bound to talk, especially at such delicate moments as this, she invariably did so with an air of haughty defiance. She always knew beforehand when she was going to blush, long before the blush came.",
            "\u201cPerhaps you do not wish to accept my proposition?\u201d she asked, gazing haughtily at the prince.",
            "\u201cOh yes, I do; but it is so unnecessary. I mean, I did not think you need make such a proposition,\u201d said the prince, looking confused.",
            "\u201cWhat did you suppose, then? Why did you think I invited you out here? I suppose you think me a \u2018little fool,\u2019 as they all call me at home?\u201d",
            "\u201cI didn\u2019t know they called you a fool. I certainly don\u2019t think you one.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t think me one! Oh, dear me!\u2014that\u2019s very clever of you; you put it so neatly, too.\u201d",
            "\u201cIn my opinion, you are far from a fool sometimes\u2014in fact, you are very intelligent. You said a very clever thing just now about my being unjust because I had _only_ justice. I shall remember that, and think about it.\u201d",
            "Aglaya blushed with pleasure. All these changes in her expression came about so naturally and so rapidly\u2014they delighted the prince; he watched her, and laughed.",
            "\u201cListen,\u201d she began again; \u201cI have long waited to tell you all this, ever since the time when you sent me that letter\u2014even before that. Half of what I have to say you heard yesterday. I consider you the most honest and upright of men\u2014more honest and upright than any other man; and if anybody says that your mind is\u2014is sometimes affected, you know\u2014it is unfair. I always say so and uphold it, because even if your surface mind be a little affected (of course you will not feel angry with me for talking so\u2014I am speaking from a higher point of view) yet your real mind is far better than all theirs put together. Such a mind as they have never even _dreamed_ of; because really, there are _two_ minds\u2014the kind that matters, and the kind that doesn\u2019t matter. Isn\u2019t it so?\u201d",
            "\u201cMay be! may be so!\u201d said the prince, faintly; his heart was beating painfully.",
            "\u201cI knew you would not misunderstand me,\u201d she said, triumphantly. \u201cPrince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and Alexandra don\u2019t understand anything about these two kinds of mind, but, just fancy, mamma does!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are very like Lizabetha Prokofievna.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat! surely not?\u201d said Aglaya.",
            "\u201cYes, you are, indeed.\u201d",
            "\u201cThank you; I am glad to be like mamma,\u201d she said, thoughtfully. \u201cYou respect her very much, don\u2019t you?\u201d she added, quite unconscious of the naiveness of the question.",
            "\u201c_Very_ much; and I am so glad that you have realized the fact.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am very glad, too, because she is often laughed at by people. But listen to the chief point. I have long thought over the matter, and at last I have chosen you. I don\u2019t wish people to laugh at me; I don\u2019t wish people to think me a \u2018little fool.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be chaffed. I felt all this of a sudden, and I refused Evgenie Pavlovitch flatly, because I am not going to be forever thrown at people\u2019s heads to be married. I want\u2014I want\u2014well, I\u2019ll tell you, I wish to run away from home, and I have chosen you to help me.\u201d",

            "\u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014yes! Run away from home!\u201d she repeated, in a transport of rage. \u201cI won\u2019t, I won\u2019t be made to blush every minute by them all! I don\u2019t want to blush before Prince S. or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or anyone, and therefore I have chosen you. I shall tell you everything, _everything_, even the most important things of all, whenever I like, and you are to hide nothing from me on your side. I want to speak to at least one person, as I would to myself. They have suddenly begun to say that I am waiting for you, and in love with you. They began this before you arrived here, and so I didn\u2019t show them the letter, and now they all say it, every one of them. I want to be brave, and be afraid of nobody. I don\u2019t want to go to their balls and things\u2014I want to do good. I have long desired to run away, for I have been kept shut up for twenty years, and they are always trying to marry me off. I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old\u2014I was a little fool then, I know\u2014but now I have worked it all out, and I have waited for you to tell me about foreign countries. I have never seen a single Gothic cathedral. I must go to Rome; I must see all the museums; I must study in Paris. All this last year I have been preparing and reading forbidden books. Alexandra and Adelaida are allowed to read anything they like, but I mayn\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with my sisters, but I told my parents long ago that I wish to change my social position. I have decided to take up teaching, and I count on you because you said you loved children. Can we go in for education together\u2014if not at once, then afterwards? We could do good together. I won\u2019t be a general\u2019s daughter any more! Tell me, are you a very learned man?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no; not at all.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh-h-h! I\u2019m sorry for that. I thought you were. I wonder why I always thought so\u2014but at all events you\u2019ll help me, won\u2019t you? Because I\u2019ve chosen you, you know.\u201d",
            "\u201cAglaya Ivanovna, it\u2019s absurd.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I will, I _will_ run away!\u201d she cried\u2014and her eyes flashed again with anger\u2014\u201cand if you don\u2019t agree I shall go and marry Gavrila Ardalionovitch! I won\u2019t be considered a horrible girl, and accused of goodness knows what.\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d cried the prince, almost starting from his seat. \u201cWhat do they accuse you of? Who accuses you?\u201d",
            "\u201cAt home, everybody, mother, my sisters, Prince S., even that detestable Colia! If they don\u2019t say it, they think it. I told them all so to their faces. I told mother and father and everybody. Mamma was ill all the day after it, and next day father and Alexandra told me that I didn\u2019t understand what nonsense I was talking. I informed them that they little knew me\u2014I was not a small child\u2014I understood every word in the language\u2014that I had read a couple of Paul de Kok\u2019s novels two years since on purpose, so as to know all about everything. No sooner did mamma hear me say this than she nearly fainted!\u201d",
            "A strange thought passed through the prince\u2019s brain; he gazed intently at Aglaya and smiled.",
            "He could not believe that this was the same haughty young girl who had once so proudly shown him Gania\u2019s letter. He could not understand how that proud and austere beauty could show herself to be such an utter child\u2014a child who probably did not even now understand some words.",

            "\u201cNo\u2014never\u2014nowhere! I\u2019ve been at home all my life, corked up in a bottle; and they expect me to be married straight out of it. What are you laughing at again? I observe that you, too, have taken to laughing at me, and range yourself on their side against me,\u201d she added, frowning angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t irritate me\u2014I\u2019m bad enough without that\u2014I don\u2019t know what I am doing sometimes. I am persuaded that you came here today in the full belief that I am in love with you, and that I arranged this meeting because of that,\u201d she cried, with annoyance.",
            "\u201cI admit I was afraid that that was the case, yesterday,\u201d blundered the prince (he was rather confused), \u201cbut today I am quite convinced that\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cHow?\u201d cried Aglaya\u2014and her lower lip trembled violently. \u201cYou were _afraid_ that I\u2014you dared to think that I\u2014good gracious! you suspected, perhaps, that I sent for you to come here in order to catch you in a trap, so that they should find us here together, and make you marry me\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cAglaya Ivanovna, aren\u2019t you ashamed of saying such a thing? How could such a horrible idea enter your sweet, innocent heart? I am certain you don\u2019t believe a word of what you say, and probably you don\u2019t even know what you are talking about.\u201d",
            "Aglaya sat with her eyes on the ground; she seemed to have alarmed even herself by what she had said.",
            "\u201cNo, I\u2019m not; I\u2019m not a bit ashamed!\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd how do you know my heart is innocent? And how dared you send me a love-letter that time?\u201d",
            "\u201c_Love-letter?_ My letter a love-letter? That letter was the most respectful of letters; it went straight from my heart, at what was perhaps the most painful moment of my life! I thought of you at the time as a kind of light. I\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, very well, very well!\u201d she said, but quite in a different tone. She was remorseful now, and bent forward to touch his shoulder, though still trying not to look him in the face, as if the more persuasively to beg him not to be angry with her. \u201cVery well,\u201d she continued, looking thoroughly ashamed of herself, \u201cI feel that I said a very foolish thing. I only did it just to try you. Take it as unsaid, and if I offended you, forgive me. Don\u2019t look straight at me like that, please; turn your head away. You called it a \u2018horrible idea\u2019; I only said it to shock you. Very often I am myself afraid of saying what I intend to say, and out it comes all the same. You have just told me that you wrote that letter at the most painful moment of your life. I know what moment that was!\u201d she added softly, looking at the ground again.",

            "\u201cI _do_ know all!\u201d she cried, with another burst of indignation. \u201cYou were living in the same house as that horrible woman with whom you ran away.\u201d She did not blush as she said this; on the contrary, she grew pale, and started from her seat, apparently oblivious of what she did, and immediately sat down again. Her lip continued to tremble for a long time.",
            "There was silence for a moment. The prince was taken aback by the suddenness of this last reply, and did not know to what he should attribute it.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t love you a bit!\u201d she said suddenly, just as though the words had exploded from her mouth.",
            "The prince did not answer, and there was silence again. \u201cI love Gavrila Ardalionovitch,\u201d she said, quickly; but hardly audibly, and with her head bent lower than ever.",

            "\u201cYou are wonderfully polite. You know he is greatly improved. He loves me better than his life. He let his hand burn before my very eyes in order to prove to me that he loved me better than his life!\u201d",

He brought a box of matches too, if you like, and then lighted the candle and held his finger in it for half an hour and more!\u2014There! Can\u2019t that be?\u201d",

I\u2019ve noticed this. But I managed it badly; I didn\u2019t know how to work it.\u201d She suddenly frowned again at this point as though at some sudden unpleasant recollection.",

You see, I am merely stating facts without any comment upon them. After that she ran away with Rogojin. Then you lived with her at some village or town, and she ran away from you.\u201d (Aglaya blushed dreadfully.) \u201cThen she returned to Rogojin again, who loves her like a madman. Then you\u2014like a wise man as you are\u2014came back here after her as soon as ever you heard that she had returned to Petersburg. Yesterday evening you sprang forward to protect her, and just now you dreamed about her. You see, I know all. You did come back here for her, for her\u2014now didn\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014for her!\u201d said the prince softly and sadly, and bending his head down, quite unconscious of the fact that Aglaya was gazing at him with eyes which burned like live coals. \u201cI came to find out something\u2014I don\u2019t believe in her future happiness as Rogojin\u2019s wife, although\u2014in a word, I did not know how to help her or what to do for her\u2014but I came, on the chance.\u201d",

Why I should wish to tell you, and only you, this experience of mine, I really cannot say; perhaps it really is because I love you very much.

She has suffered too much already in the consciousness of her own undeserved shame.",
            "\u201cAnd she is not guilty\u2014oh God!\u2014Every moment she bemoans and bewails herself, and cries out that she does not admit any guilt, that she is the victim of circumstances\u2014the victim of a wicked libertine.",

Simply to prove to me what is not true\u2014that she is base. But the worst of it is, she did not realize herself that that was all she wanted to prove by her departure! She went away in response to some inner prompting to do something disgraceful, in order that she might say to herself\u2014\u2018There\u2014you\u2019ve done a new act of shame\u2014you degraded creature!\u2019",

You don\u2019t suppose she can be happy among such people as those\u2014you cannot suppose that such society is fit for her? You have no idea how well-educated she is, and what an intellect she has!

She\u2014well, she is clever, though she may be mad\u2014much cleverer than I am, as you say. Well, she writes that she is in love with me herself, and tries to see me every day, if only from a distance. She writes that you love me, and that she has long known it and seen it, and that you and she talked about me\u2014there. She wishes to see you happy, and she says that she is certain only I can ensure you the happiness you deserve. She writes such strange, wild letters\u2014I haven\u2019t shown them to anyone. Now, do you know what all this means? Can you guess anything?\u201d",

            "\u201cIf so, you are a heartless man!\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cAs if you can\u2019t see that it is not myself she loves, but you, you, and only you! Surely you have not remarked everything else in her, and only not _this?_ Do you know what these letters mean? They mean jealousy, sir\u2014nothing but pure jealousy! She\u2014do you think she will ever really marry this Rogojin, as she says here she will? She would take her own life the day after you and I were married.\u201d",

But I know for _certain_, that if she married me it would be her ruin; I know this and therefore I leave her alone. I ought to go to see her today; now I shall probably not go. She is proud, she would never forgive me the nature of the love I bear her, and we should both be ruined. This may be unnatural, I don\u2019t know; but everything seems unnatural. You say she loves me, as if this were _love!_ As if she could love _me_, after what I have been through! No, no, it is not love.\u201d",

Kindly take these three letters, Lef Nicolaievitch, and throw them back to her, from me. And if she dares,\u201d cried Aglaya suddenly, much louder than before, \u201cif she dares so much as write me one word again, tell her I shall tell my father, and that she shall be taken to a lunatic asylum.\u201d",

            "The girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country; Aglaya, of late, had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and having a walk in the garden, but not at seven o\u2019clock; about eight or a little later was her usual time.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna, who really had not slept all night, rose at about eight on purpose to meet Aglaya in the garden and walk with her; but she could not find her either in the garden or in her own room.",
            "This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other daughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into the park before seven o\u2019clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglaya\u2019s last freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for her, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it.",
            "Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing the strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what she had undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by appointment?",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t suppose, prince,\u201d she began, bracing herself up for the effort, \u201cdon\u2019t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After last night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all; I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.\u201d She paused.",
            "\u201cBut at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?\u201d The prince finished her speech for her with the utmost composure.",
            "\u201cWell, what then? Supposing I should like to know?\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, blushing. \u201cI\u2019m sure I am not afraid of plain speaking. I\u2019m not offending anyone, and I never wish to, and\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cPardon me, it is no offence to wish to know this; you are her mother. We met at the green bench this morning, punctually at seven o\u2019clock,\u2014according to an agreement made by Aglaya Ivanovna with myself yesterday. She said that she wished to see me and speak to me about something important. We met and conversed for an hour about matters concerning Aglaya Ivanovna herself, and that\u2019s all.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course it is all, my friend. I don\u2019t doubt you for a moment,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna with dignity.",
            "\u201cWell done, prince, capital!\u201d cried Aglaya, who entered the room at this moment. \u201cThank you for assuming that I would not demean myself with lies. Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou know I have never needed to blush before you, up to this day, though perhaps you would have been glad enough to make me,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna,\u2014with majesty. \u201cGood-bye, prince; forgive me for bothering you. I trust you will rest assured of my unalterable esteem for you.\u201d",
            "The prince made his bows and retired at once. Alexandra and Adelaida smiled and whispered to each other, while Lizabetha Prokofievna glared severely at them. \u201cWe are only laughing at the prince\u2019s beautiful bows, mamma,\u201d said Adelaida. \u201cSometimes he bows just like a meal-sack, but to-day he was like\u2014like Evgenie Pavlovitch!\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is the _heart_ which is the best teacher of refinement and dignity, not the dancing-master,\u201d said her mother, sententiously, and departed upstairs to her own room, not so much as glancing at Aglaya.",
            "When the prince reached home, about nine o\u2019clock, he found Vera Lebedeff and the maid on the verandah. They were both busy trying to tidy up the place after last night\u2019s disorderly party.",

            "\u201cReally?\u201d asked the prince, gleefully, and he laughed in delight.",
            "But Vera, simple-minded little girl that she was (just like a boy, in fact), here became dreadfully confused, of a sudden, and ran hastily out of the room, laughing and blushing.",
            "\u201cWhat a dear little thing she is,\u201d thought the prince, and immediately forgot all about her.",
            "He walked to the far end of the verandah, where the sofa stood, with a table in front of it. Here he sat down and covered his face with his hands, and so remained for ten minutes. Suddenly he put his hand in his coat-pocket and hurriedly produced three letters.",
            "But the door opened again, and out came Colia.",

I have been having my turn at the bedside for the last two hours; Kostia Lebedeff is there now. Burdovsky has gone. Now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable, and sleep well!

If Voltaire had written this now, or Rousseau, I should have just read it and thought it remarkable, but should not have been so _impressed_ by it. But a man who knows for certain that he has but ten minutes to live and can talk like that\u2014why\u2014it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s _pride_, that is! It is really a most extraordinary, exalted assertion of personal dignity, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s _defiant!_ What a _gigantic_ strength of will, eh? And to accuse a fellow like that of not putting in the cap on purpose; it\u2019s base and mean! You know he deceived us last night, the cunning rascal. I never packed his bag for him, and I never saw his pistol. He packed it himself. But he put me off my guard like that, you see. Vera says you are going to let him stay on; I swear there\u2019s no danger, especially as we are always with him.\u201d",

            "\u201cI, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff. Keller stayed a little while, and then went over to Lebedeff\u2019s to sleep. Ferdishenko slept at Lebedeff\u2019s, too; but he went away at seven o\u2019clock. My father is always at Lebedeff\u2019s; but he has gone out just now. I dare say Lebedeff will be coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; I don\u2019t know what he wants. Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep? I\u2019m going to have a nap, too. By-the-by, such a curious thing happened. Burdovsky woke me at seven, and I met my father just outside the room, so drunk, he didn\u2019t even know me. He stood before me like a log, and when he recovered himself, asked hurriedly how Hippolyte was. \u2018Yes,\u2019 he said, when I told him, \u2018that\u2019s all very well, but I _really_ came to warn you that you must be very careful what you say before Ferdishenko.\u2019 Do you follow me, prince?\u201d",

Well, I forgot the money in the pocket of my old coat\u2014you know when God will ruin a man he first of all bereaves him of his senses\u2014and it was only this morning at half-past seven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first thing.

            "\u201cCertainly. Anything is possible when one is intoxicated, as you neatly express it, prince. But consider\u2014if I, intoxicated or not, dropped an object out of my pocket on to the ground, that object ought to remain on the ground. Where is the object, then?\u201d",
            "\u201cDidn\u2019t you put it away in some drawer, perhaps?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve looked everywhere, and turned out everything.\u201d",
            "\u201cI confess this disturbs me a good deal. Someone must have picked it up, then.\u201d",

            "\u201cIt is very distressing, because _who_\u2014? That\u2019s the question!\u201d",

            "\u201cSarcasm!\u201d cried Lebedeff, wringing his hands. \u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m only put out about this. Whom do you suspect?\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is a very difficult and complicated question. I cannot suspect the servant, for she was in the kitchen the whole evening, nor do I suspect any of my children.\u201d",
            "\u201cI should think not. Go on.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen it must be one of the guests.\u201d",

            "\u201cAbsolutely and utterly impossible\u2014and yet, so it must be. But one thing I am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the evening when we were all together, but either at night or early in the morning; therefore, by one of those who slept here. Burdovsky and Colia I except, of course. They did not even come into my room.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, or even if they had! But who did sleep with you?\u201d",
            "\u201cFour of us, including myself, in two rooms. The general, myself, Keller, and Ferdishenko. One of us four it must have been. I don\u2019t suspect myself, though such cases have been known.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! _do_ go on, Lebedeff! Don\u2019t drag it out so.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, there are three left, then\u2014Keller firstly. He is a drunkard to begin with, and a liberal (in the sense of other people\u2019s pockets), otherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern liberal. He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards because there was no place to lie down in the room and the floor was so hard.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou suspect him?\u201d",
            "\u201cI _did_ suspect him. When I woke up at half-past seven and tore my hair in despair for my loss and carelessness, I awoke the general, who was sleeping the sleep of innocence near me. Taking into consideration the sudden disappearance of Ferdishenko, which was suspicious in itself, we decided to search Keller, who was lying there sleeping like a top. Well, we searched his clothes thoroughly, and not a farthing did we find; in fact, his pockets all had holes in them. We found a dirty handkerchief, and a love-letter from some scullery-maid. The general decided that he was innocent. We awoke him for further inquiries, and had the greatest difficulty in making him understand what was up. He opened his mouth and stared\u2014he looked so stupid and so absurdly innocent. It wasn\u2019t Keller.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad!\u201d said the prince, joyfully. \u201cI was so afraid.\u201d",

            "\u201cOh no\u2014not a bit! It was foolish of me to say I was afraid! Don\u2019t repeat it please, Lebedeff, don\u2019t tell anyone I said that!\u201d",
            "\u201cMy dear prince! your words lie in the lowest depth of my heart\u2014it is their tomb!\u201d said Lebedeff, solemnly, pressing his hat to the region of his heart.",

            "\u201cHe does not know of it; I have kept it a secret. Very well, Ferdishenko went off to Wilkin\u2019s. That is not so curious in itself, but here the evidence opens out further. He left his address, you see, when he went. Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address? Why do you suppose he went out of his way to tell Colia that he had gone to Wilkin\u2019s? Who cared to know that he was going to Wilkin\u2019s? No, no! prince, this is finesse, thieves\u2019 finesse! This is as good as saying, \u2018There, how can I be a thief when I leave my address? I\u2019m not concealing my movements as a thief would.\u2019 Do you understand, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh yes, but that is not enough.\u201d",

An hour after\u2014that is at about eight, I went to Wilkin\u2019s myself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko. The maid did tell me, certainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the door, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door because she didn\u2019t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy to get up herself. Such phenomena are met with occasionally!\u201d",

            "\u201cOf course you have given me a disagreeable enough thing to think about,\u201d said the prince, irritably, \u201cbut what are you going to do, since you are so sure it was Ferdishenko?\u201d",
            "\u201cBut who else _could_ it be, my very dear prince?\u201d repeated Lebedeff, as sweet as sugar again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t wish me to suspect Mr. Burdovsky?\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course not.\u201d",
            "\u201cNor the general? Ha, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "\u201cNonsense!\u201d said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him.",
            "\u201cQuite so, nonsense! Ha, ha, ha! dear me! He did amuse me, did the general! We went off on the hot scent to Wilkin\u2019s together, you know; but I must first observe that the general was even more thunderstruck than I myself this morning, when I awoke him after discovering the theft; so much so that his very face changed\u2014he grew red and then pale, and at length flew into a paroxysm of such noble wrath that I assure you I was quite surprised! He is a most generous-hearted man! He tells lies by the thousands, I know, but it is merely a weakness; he is a man of the highest feelings; a simple-minded man too, and a man who carries the conviction of innocence in his very appearance. I love that man, sir; I may have told you so before; it is a weakness of mine. Well\u2014he suddenly stopped in the middle of the road, opened out his coat and bared his breast. \u2018Search me,\u2019 he says, \u2018you searched Keller; why don\u2019t you search me too? It is only fair!\u2019 says he. And all the while his legs and hands were trembling with anger, and he as white as a sheet all over! So I said to him, \u2018Nonsense, general; if anybody but yourself had said that to me, I\u2019d have taken my head, my own head, and put it on a large dish and carried it round to anyone who suspected you; and I should have said: \u201cThere, you see that head? It\u2019s my head, and I\u2019ll go bail with that head for him! Yes, and walk through the fire for him, too.\u201d There,\u2019 says I, \u2018that\u2019s how I\u2019d answer for you, general!\u2019 Then he embraced me, in the middle of the street, and hugged me so tight (crying over me all the while) that I coughed fit to choke! \u2018You are the one friend left to me amid all my misfortunes,\u2019 says he. Oh, he\u2019s a man of sentiment, that! He went on to tell me a story of how he had been accused, or suspected, of stealing five hundred thousand roubles once, as a young man; and how, the very next day, he had rushed into a burning, blazing house and saved the very count who suspected him, and Nina Alexandrovna (who was then a young girl), from a fiery death. The count embraced him, and that was how he came to marry Nina Alexandrovna, he said. As for the money, it was found among the ruins next day in an English iron box with a secret lock; it had got under the floor somehow, and if it had not been for the fire it would never have been found! The whole thing is, of course, an absolute fabrication, though when he spoke of Nina Alexandrovna he wept! She\u2019s a grand woman, is Nina Alexandrovna, though she is very angry with me!\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you acquainted with her?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, hardly at all. I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying myself in her eyes. Nina Alexandrovna has a grudge against me for, as she thinks, encouraging her husband in drinking; whereas in reality I not only do not encourage him, but I actually keep him out of harm\u2019s way, and out of bad company. Besides, he\u2019s my friend, prince, so that I shall not lose sight of him, again. Where he goes, I go. He\u2019s quite given up visiting the captain\u2019s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly of her, especially in the morning, when he\u2019s putting on his boots. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s at that time. But he has no money, and it\u2019s no use his going to see her without. Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, he has not.\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, he\u2019s ashamed to! He _meant_ to ask you, I know, for he said so. I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you would probably refuse if he asked you again.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you ever give him money?\u201d",
            "\u201cPrince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that\u2019s exaggeration; not life, we\u2019ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man fallen\u2014money, indeed!\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m, then you _do_ give him money?\u201d",
            "\u201cN-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways. He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to Petersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I\u2019m certain he is there. I shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we have so arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see, from different sides. But I am going to follow that naughty old general and catch him, I know where, at a certain widow\u2019s house; for I think it will be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, Lebedeff, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make any scandal about it!\u201d said the prince, much agitated, and speaking in a low voice.",
            "\u201cNot for the world, not for the world! I merely wish to make him ashamed of himself. Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to myself, I cannot help thinking of his morals! I have a great favour to ask of you, esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of my visit. You know the Ivolgins, you have even lived in their house; so if you would lend me your help, honoured prince, in the general\u2019s own interest and for his good.\u201d",
            "Lebedeff clasped his hands in supplication.",
            "\u201cWhat help do you want from me? You may be certain that I am most anxious to understand you, Lebedeff.\u201d",
            "\u201cI felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you. We might manage it with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely watched in his own house. Unfortunately I am not on terms... otherwise... but Nicolai Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his youthful soul, might help, too.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no! Heaven forbid that we should bring Nina Alexandrovna into this business! Or Colia, either. But perhaps I have not yet quite understood you, Lebedeff?\u201d",
            "Lebedeff made an impatient movement.",
            "\u201cBut there is nothing to understand! Sympathy and tenderness, that is all\u2014that is all our poor invalid requires! You will permit me to consider him an invalid?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, it shows delicacy and intelligence on your part.\u201d",
            "\u201cI will explain my idea by a practical example, to make it clearer. You know the sort of man he is. At present his only failing is that he is crazy about that captain\u2019s widow, and he cannot go to her without money, and I mean to catch him at her house today\u2014for his own good; but supposing it was not only the widow, but that he had committed a real crime, or at least some very dishonourable action (of which he is, of course, incapable), I repeat that even in that case, if he were treated with what I may call generous tenderness, one could get at the whole truth, for he is very soft-hearted! Believe me, he would betray himself before five days were out; he would burst into tears, and make a clean breast of the matter; especially if managed with tact, and if you and his family watched his every step, so to speak. Oh, my dear prince,\u201d Lebedeff added most emphatically, \u201cI do not positively assert that he has... I am ready, as the saying is, to shed my last drop of blood for him this instant; but you will admit that debauchery, drunkenness, and the captain\u2019s widow, all these together may lead him very far.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am, of course, quite ready to add my efforts to yours in such a case,\u201d said the prince, rising; \u201cbut I confess, Lebedeff, that I am terribly perplexed. Tell me, do you still think... plainly, you say yourself that you suspect Mr. Ferdishenko?\u201d",
            "Lebedeff clasped his hands once more.",
            "\u201cWhy, who else could I possibly suspect? Who else, most outspoken prince?\u201d he replied, with an unctuous smile.",
            "Muishkin frowned, and rose from his seat.",
            "\u201cYou see, Lebedeff, a mistake here would be a dreadful thing. This Ferdishenko, I would not say a word against him, of course; but, who knows? Perhaps it really was he? I mean he really does seem to be a more likely man than... than any other.\u201d",
            "Lebedeff strained his eyes and ears to take in what the prince was saying. The latter was frowning more and more, and walking excitedly up and down, trying not to look at Lebedeff.",

One has to take care not to say too much, you understand? I say this to prove that he really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone else, eh? You understand? The important thing is, not to make a mistake.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd who told you this about Ferdishenko?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I was told. Of course I don\u2019t altogether believe it. I am very sorry that I should have had to say this, because I assure you I don\u2019t believe it myself; it is all nonsense, of course. It was stupid of me to say anything about it.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou see, it is very important, it is most important to know where you got this report from,\u201d said Lebedeff, excitedly. He had risen from his seat, and was trying to keep step with the prince, running after him, up and down. \u201cBecause look here, prince, I don\u2019t mind telling you now that as we were going along to Wilkin\u2019s this morning, after telling me what you know about the fire, and saving the count and all that, the general was pleased to drop certain hints to the same effect about Ferdishenko, but so vaguely and clumsily that I thought better to put a few questions to him on the matter, with the result that I found the whole thing was an invention of his excellency\u2019s own mind. Of course, he only lies with the best intentions; still, he lies. But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report? It was the inspiration of the moment with him, you understand, so who could have told _you?_ It is an important question, you see!\u201d",
            "\u201cIt was Colia told me, and his father told _him_ at about six this morning. They met at the threshold, when Colia was leaving the room for something or other.\u201d The prince told Lebedeff all that Colia had made known to himself, in detail.",
            "\u201cThere now, that\u2019s what we may call _scent!_\u201d said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and laughing silently. \u201cI thought it must be so, you see. The general interrupted his innocent slumbers, at six o\u2019clock, in order to go and wake his beloved son, and warn him of the dreadful danger of companionship with Ferdishenko. Dear me! what a dreadfully dangerous man Ferdishenko must be, and what touching paternal solicitude, on the part of his excellency, ha! ha! ha!\u201d",
            "\u201cListen, Lebedeff,\u201d began the prince, quite overwhelmed; \u201c_do_ act quietly\u2014don\u2019t make a scandal, Lebedeff, I ask you\u2014I entreat you! No one must know\u2014_no one_, mind! In that case only, I will help you.\u201d",

Illustrious prince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest scoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or with a noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his choice! He\u2019ll answer that he prefers the noble-hearted man\u2014and there you have the triumph of virtue! _Au revoir_, honoured prince! You and I together\u2014softly! softly!\u201d "

            "When he fell into a heavy sleep on the sofa on the verandah, without having had the courage to open a single one of the three envelopes, he again dreamed a painful dream, and once more that poor, \u201csinful\u201d woman appeared to him. Again she gazed at him with tears sparkling on her long lashes, and beckoned him after her; and again he awoke, as before, with the picture of her face haunting him.",
            "He longed to get up and go to her at once\u2014but he _could not_. At length, almost in despair, he unfolded the letters, and began to read them.",
            "These letters, too, were like a dream. We sometimes have strange, impossible dreams, contrary to all the laws of nature. When we awake we remember them and wonder at their strangeness. You remember, perhaps, that you were in full possession of your reason during this succession of fantastic images; even that you acted with extraordinary logic and cunning while surrounded by murderers who hid their intentions and made great demonstrations of friendship, while waiting for an opportunity to cut your throat. You remember how you escaped them by some ingenious stratagem; then you doubted if they were really deceived, or whether they were only pretending not to know your hiding-place; then you thought of another plan and hoodwinked them once again. You remember all this quite clearly, but how is it that your reason calmly accepted all the manifest absurdities and impossibilities that crowded into your dream? One of the murderers suddenly changed into a woman before your very eyes; then the woman was transformed into a hideous, cunning little dwarf; and you believed it, and accepted it all almost as a matter of course\u2014while at the same time your intelligence seemed unusually keen, and accomplished miracles of cunning, sagacity, and logic! Why is it that when you awake to the world of realities you nearly always feel, sometimes very vividly, that the vanished dream has carried with it some enigma which you have failed to solve? You smile at the extravagance of your dream, and yet you feel that this tissue of absurdity contained some real idea, something that belongs to your true life,\u2014something that exists, and has always existed, in your heart. You search your dream for some prophecy that you were expecting. It has left a deep impression upon you, joyful or cruel, but what it means, or what has been predicted to you in it, you can neither understand nor remember.",
            "The reading of these letters produced some such effect upon the prince. He felt, before he even opened the envelopes, that the very fact of their existence was like a nightmare. How could she ever have made up her mind to write to her? he asked himself. How could she write about that at all? And how could such a wild idea have entered her head? And yet, the strangest part of the matter was, that while he read the letters, he himself almost believed in the possibility, and even in the justification, of the idea he had thought so wild. Of course it was a mad dream, a nightmare, and yet there was something cruelly real about it. For hours he was haunted by what he had read. Several passages returned again and again to his mind, and as he brooded over them, he felt inclined to say to himself that he had foreseen and known all that was written here; it even seemed to him that he had read the whole of this some time or other, long, long ago; and all that had tormented and grieved him up to now was to be found in these old, long since read, letters.",

But I must confess one sin against you\u2014I love you. One should not love perfection. One should only look on it as perfection\u2014yet I am in love with you. Though love equalizes, do not fear. I have not lowered you to my level, even in my most secret thoughts. I have written \u2018Do not fear,\u2019 as if you could fear. I would kiss your footprints if I could; but, oh! I am not putting myself on a level with you!\u2014Look at the signature\u2014quick, look at the signature!\u201d",

He fell in love with you, though he saw you but once. He spoke of you as of \u2018the light.\u2019 These are his own words\u2014I heard him use them. But I understood without his saying it that you were all that light is to him. I lived near him for a whole month, and I understood then that you, too, must love him.

If I were to bring you to the most loathsome den, and show you the revelation of undisguised vice\u2014you should not blush. You can never feel the sense of personal affront. You may hate all who are mean, or base, or unworthy\u2014but not for yourself\u2014only for those whom they wrong. No one can wrong _you_. Do you know, I think you ought to love me\u2014for you are the same in my eyes as in his\u2014you are as light. An angel cannot hate, perhaps cannot love, either. I often ask myself\u2014is it possible to love everybody? Indeed it is not; it is not in nature. Abstract love of humanity is nearly always love of self. But you are different. You cannot help loving all, since you can compare with none, and are above all personal offence or anger. Oh! how bitter it would be to me to know that you felt anger or shame on my account, for that would be your fall\u2014you would become comparable at once with such as me.",

I should represent Christ alone\u2014the disciples did leave Him alone occasionally. I should paint one little child left with Him. This child has been playing about near Him, and had probably just been telling the Saviour something in its pretty baby prattle. Christ had listened to it, but was now musing\u2014one hand reposing on the child\u2019s bright head. His eyes have a far-away expression. Thought, great as the Universe, is in them\u2014His face is sad. The little one leans its elbow upon Christ\u2019s knee, and with its cheek resting on its hand, gazes up at Him, pondering as children sometimes do ponder. The sun is setting. There you have my picture.",

I know that once when your sister Adelaida saw my portrait she said that such beauty could overthrow the world. But I have renounced the world. You think it strange that I should say so, for you saw me decked with lace and diamonds, in the company of drunkards and wastrels. Take no notice of that; I know that I have almost ceased to exist. God knows what it is dwelling within me now\u2014it is not myself. I can see it every day in two dreadful eyes which are always looking at me, even when not present. These eyes are silent now, they say nothing; but I know their secret. His house is gloomy, and there is a secret in it. I am convinced that in some box he has a razor hidden, tied round with silk, just like the one that Moscow murderer had. This man also lived with his mother, and had a razor hidden away, tied round with white silk, and with this razor he intended to cut a throat.",

            "There are certain people of whom it is difficult to say anything which will at once throw them into relief\u2014in other words, describe them graphically in their typical characteristics. These are they who are generally known as \u201ccommonplace people,\u201d and this class comprises, of course, the immense majority of mankind. Authors, as a rule, attempt to select and portray types rarely met with in their entirety, but these types are nevertheless more real than real life itself.",
            "\u201cPodkoleosin\u201d [A character in Gogol\u2019s comedy, The Wedding.] was perhaps an exaggeration, but he was by no means a non-existent character; on the contrary, how many intelligent people, after hearing of this Podkoleosin from Gogol, immediately began to find that scores of their friends were exactly like him! They knew, perhaps, before Gogol told them, that their friends were like Podkoleosin, but they did not know what name to give them. In real life, young fellows seldom jump out of the window just before their weddings, because such a feat, not to speak of its other aspects, must be a decidedly unpleasant mode of escape; and yet there are plenty of bridegrooms, intelligent fellows too, who would be ready to confess themselves Podkoleosins in the depths of their consciousness, just before marriage. Nor does every husband feel bound to repeat at every step, \u201c_Tu l\u2019as voulu, Georges Dandin!_\u201d like another typical personage; and yet how many millions and billions of Georges Dandins there are in real life who feel inclined to utter this soul-drawn cry after their honeymoon, if not the day after the wedding! Therefore, without entering into any more serious examination of the question, I will content myself with remarking that in real life typical characters are \u201cwatered down,\u201d so to speak; and all these Dandins and Podkoleosins actually exist among us every day, but in a diluted form. I will just add, however, that Georges Dandin might have existed exactly as Moli\u00e8re presented him, and probably does exist now and then, though rarely; and so I will end this scientific examination, which is beginning to look like a newspaper criticism. But for all this, the question remains,\u2014what are the novelists to do with commonplace people, and how are they to be presented to the reader in such a form as to be in the least degree interesting? They cannot be left out altogether, for commonplace people meet one at every turn of life, and to leave them out would be to destroy the whole reality and probability of the story. To fill a novel with typical characters only, or with merely strange and uncommon people, would render the book unreal and improbable, and would very likely destroy the interest. In my opinion, the duty of the novelist is to seek out points of interest and instruction even in the characters of commonplace people.",
            "For instance, when the whole essence of an ordinary person\u2019s nature lies in his perpetual and unchangeable commonplaceness; and when in spite of all his endeavours to do something out of the common, this person ends, eventually, by remaining in his unbroken line of routine\u2014. I think such an individual really does become a type of his own\u2014a type of commonplaceness which will not for the world, if it can help it, be contented, but strains and yearns to be something original and independent, without the slightest possibility of being so. To this class of commonplace people belong several characters in this novel;\u2014characters which\u2014I admit\u2014I have not drawn very vividly up to now for my reader\u2019s benefit.",
            "Such were, for instance, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, her husband, and her brother, Gania.",
            "There is nothing so annoying as to be fairly rich, of a fairly good family, pleasing presence, average education, to be \u201cnot stupid,\u201d kind-hearted, and yet to have no talent at all, no originality, not a single idea of one\u2019s own\u2014to be, in fact, \u201cjust like everyone else.\u201d",
            "Of such people there are countless numbers in this world\u2014far more even than appear. They can be divided into two classes as all men can\u2014that is, those of limited intellect, and those who are much cleverer. The former of these classes is the happier.",
            "To a commonplace man of limited intellect, for instance, nothing is simpler than to imagine himself an original character, and to revel in that belief without the slightest misgiving.",
            "Many of our young women have thought fit to cut their hair short, put on blue spectacles, and call themselves Nihilists. By doing this they have been able to persuade themselves, without further trouble, that they have acquired new convictions of their own. Some men have but felt some little qualm of kindness towards their fellow-men, and the fact has been quite enough to persuade them that they stand alone in the van of enlightenment and that no one has such humanitarian feelings as they. Others have but to read an idea of somebody else\u2019s, and they can immediately assimilate it and believe that it was a child of their own brain. The \u201cimpudence of ignorance,\u201d if I may use the expression, is developed to a wonderful extent in such cases;\u2014unlikely as it appears, it is met with at every turn.",
            "This confidence of a stupid man in his own talents has been wonderfully depicted by Gogol in the amazing character of Pirogoff. Pirogoff has not the slightest doubt of his own genius,\u2014nay, of his _superiority_ of genius,\u2014so certain is he of it that he never questions it. How many Pirogoffs have there not been among our writers\u2014scholars, propagandists? I say \u201chave been,\u201d but indeed there are plenty of them at this very day.",
            "Our friend, Gania, belonged to the other class\u2014to the \u201cmuch cleverer\u201d persons, though he was from head to foot permeated and saturated with the longing to be original. This class, as I have said above, is far less happy. For the \u201cclever commonplace\u201d person, though he may possibly imagine himself a man of genius and originality, none the less has within his heart the deathless worm of suspicion and doubt; and this doubt sometimes brings a clever man to despair. (As a rule, however, nothing tragic happens;\u2014his liver becomes a little damaged in the course of time, nothing more serious. Such men do not give up their aspirations after originality without a severe struggle,\u2014and there have been men who, though good fellows in themselves, and even benefactors to humanity, have sunk to the level of base criminals for the sake of originality).",
            "Gania was a beginner, as it were, upon this road. A deep and unchangeable consciousness of his own lack of talent, combined with a vast longing to be able to persuade himself that he was original, had rankled in his heart, even from childhood.",
            "He seemed to have been born with overwrought nerves, and in his passionate desire to excel, he was often led to the brink of some rash step; and yet, having resolved upon such a step, when the moment arrived, he invariably proved too sensible to take it. He was ready, in the same way, to do a base action in order to obtain his wished-for object; and yet, when the moment came to do it, he found that he was too honest for any great baseness. (Not that he objected to acts of petty meanness\u2014he was always ready for _them_.) He looked with hate and loathing on the poverty and downfall of his family, and treated his mother with haughty contempt, although he knew that his whole future depended on her character and reputation.",
            "Aglaya had simply frightened him; yet he did not give up all thoughts of her\u2014though he never seriously hoped that she would condescend to him. At the time of his \u201cadventure\u201d with Nastasia Philipovna he had come to the conclusion that money was his only hope\u2014money should do all for him.",
            "At the moment when he lost Aglaya, and after the scene with Nastasia, he had felt so low in his own eyes that he actually brought the money back to the prince. Of this returning of the money given to him by a madwoman who had received it from a madman, he had often repented since\u2014though he never ceased to be proud of his action. During the short time that Muishkin remained in Petersburg Gania had had time to come to hate him for his sympathy, though the prince told him that it was \u201cnot everyone who would have acted so nobly\u201d as to return the money. He had long pondered, too, over his relations with Aglaya, and had persuaded himself that with such a strange, childish, innocent character as hers, things might have ended very differently. Remorse then seized him; he threw up his post, and buried himself in self-torment and reproach.",
            "He lived at Ptitsin\u2019s, and openly showed contempt for the latter, though he always listened to his advice, and was sensible enough to ask for it when he wanted it. Gavrila Ardalionovitch was angry with Ptitsin because the latter did not care to become a Rothschild. \u201cIf you are to be a Jew,\u201d he said, \u201cdo it properly\u2014squeeze people right and left, show some character; be the King of the Jews while you are about it.\u201d",
            "Ptitsin was quiet and not easily offended\u2014he only laughed. But on one occasion he explained seriously to Gania that he was no Jew, that he did nothing dishonest, that he could not help the market price of money, that, thanks to his accurate habits, he had already a good footing and was respected, and that his business was flourishing.",
            "\u201cI shan\u2019t ever be a Rothschild, and there is no reason why I should,\u201d he added, smiling; \u201cbut I shall have a house in the Liteynaya, perhaps two, and that will be enough for me.\u201d \u201cWho knows but what I may have three!\u201d he concluded to himself; but this dream, cherished inwardly, he never confided to a soul.",
            "Nature loves and favours such people. Ptitsin will certainly have his reward, not three houses, but four, precisely because from childhood up he had realized that he would never be a Rothschild. That will be the limit of Ptitsin\u2019s fortune, and, come what may, he will never have more than four houses.",
            "Varvara Ardalionovna was not like her brother. She too, had passionate desires, but they were persistent rather than impetuous. Her plans were as wise as her methods of carrying them out. No doubt she also belonged to the category of ordinary people who dream of being original, but she soon discovered that she had not a grain of true originality, and she did not let it trouble her too much. Perhaps a certain kind of pride came to her help. She made her first concession to the demands of practical life with great resolution when she consented to marry Ptitsin. However, when she married she did not say to herself, \u201cNever mind a mean action if it leads to the end in view,\u201d as her brother would certainly have said in such a case; it is quite probable that he may have said it when he expressed his elder-brotherly satisfaction at her decision. Far from this; Varvara Ardalionovna did not marry until she felt convinced that her future husband was unassuming, agreeable, almost cultured, and that nothing on earth would tempt him to a really dishonourable deed. As to small meannesses, such trifles did not trouble her. Indeed, who is free from them? It is absurd to expect the ideal! Besides, she knew that her marriage would provide a refuge for all her family. Seeing Gania unhappy, she was anxious to help him, in spite of their former disputes and misunderstandings. Ptitsin, in a friendly way, would press his brother-in-law to enter the army. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said sometimes, jokingly, \u201cyou despise generals and generaldom, but you will see that \u2018they\u2019 will all end by being generals in their turn. You will see it if you live long enough!\u201d",
            "\u201cBut why should they suppose that I despise generals?\u201d Gania thought sarcastically to himself.",
            "To serve her brother\u2019s interests, Varvara Ardalionovna was constantly at the Epanchins\u2019 house, helped by the fact that in childhood she and Gania had played with General Ivan Fedorovitch\u2019s daughters. It would have been inconsistent with her character if in these visits she had been pursuing a chimera; her project was not chimerical at all; she was building on a firm basis\u2014on her knowledge of the character of the Epanchin family, especially Aglaya, whom she studied closely. All Varvara\u2019s efforts were directed towards bringing Aglaya and Gania together. Perhaps she achieved some result; perhaps, also, she made the mistake of depending too much upon her brother, and expecting more from him than he would ever be capable of giving. However this may be, her manoeuvres were skilful enough. For weeks at a time she would never mention Gania. Her attitude was modest but dignified, and she was always extremely truthful and sincere. Examining the depths of her conscience, she found nothing to reproach herself with, and this still further strengthened her in her designs. But Varvara Ardalionovna sometimes remarked that she felt spiteful; that there was a good deal of vanity in her, perhaps even of wounded vanity. She noticed this at certain times more than at others, and especially after her visits to the Epanchins.",
            "Today, as I have said, she returned from their house with a heavy feeling of dejection. There was a sensation of bitterness, a sort of mocking contempt, mingled with it.",
            "Arrived at her own house, Varia heard a considerable commotion going on in the upper storey, and distinguished the voices of her father and brother. On entering the salon she found Gania pacing up and down at frantic speed, pale with rage and almost tearing his hair. She frowned, and subsided on to the sofa with a tired air, and without taking the trouble to remove her hat. She very well knew that if she kept quiet and asked her brother nothing about his reason for tearing up and down the room, his wrath would fall upon her head. So she hastened to put the question:",

Upon my word, Varia, I must kick him out of the house; or else go myself,\u201d he added, probably remembering that he could not well turn people out of a house which was not his own.",

He\u2019s all to blame himself, and yet he puts on so much \u2018side\u2019 that you\u2019d think\u2014my word!\u2014\u2018It\u2019s too much trouble to go through the gate, you must break the fence for me!\u2019 That\u2019s the sort of air he puts on; but what\u2019s the matter with you, Varia?

            "\u201cThe prince is formally engaged to her\u2014that\u2019s settled. The elder sisters told me about it. Aglaya has agreed. They don\u2019t attempt to conceal it any longer; you know how mysterious and secret they have all been up to now. Adelaida\u2019s wedding is put off again, so that both can be married on one day. Isn\u2019t that delightfully romantic? Somebody ought to write a poem on it. Sit down and write an ode instead of tearing up and down like that. This evening Princess Bielokonski is to arrive; she comes just in time\u2014they have a party tonight. He is to be presented to old Bielokonski, though I believe he knows her already; probably the engagement will be openly announced.

I confess I have never been able to look at it seriously. I busied myself in it for your sake, thinking that there was no knowing what might happen with a funny girl like that to deal with. There were ninety to one chances against it. To this moment I can\u2019t make out why you wished for it.\u201d",

You remember how she used to hide in a cupboard as a child, so as to avoid seeing visitors, for hours at a time. She is just the same now; but, do you know, I think there is something serious in the matter, even from her side; I feel it, somehow. She laughs at the prince, they say, from morn to night in order to hide her real feelings; but you may be sure she finds occasion to say something or other to him on the sly, for he himself is in a state of radiant happiness. He walks in the clouds; they say he is extremely funny just now; I heard it from themselves. They seemed to be laughing at me in their sleeves\u2014those elder girls\u2014I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",

First of all, he begged her for some place, or situation, for work of some kind, and then he began to complain about _us_, about me and my husband, and you, especially _you_; he said a lot of things.\u201d",

She is capable of refusing the most brilliant party, and running away and starving in a garret with some wretched student; that\u2019s the sort of girl she is. You never could or did understand how interesting you would have seen in her eyes if you had come firmly and proudly through our misfortunes. The prince has simply caught her with hook and line; firstly, because he never thought of fishing for her, and secondly, because he is an idiot in the eyes of most people. It\u2019s quite enough for her that by accepting him she puts her family out and annoys them all round\u2014that\u2019s what she likes. You don\u2019t understand these things.\u201d",
            "\u201cWe shall see whether I understand or no!\u201d said Gania, enigmatically. \u201cBut I shouldn\u2019t like her to know all about father, all the same. I thought the prince would manage to hold his tongue about this, at least. He prevented Lebedeff spreading the news\u2014he wouldn\u2019t even tell me all when I asked him\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cThen you must see that he is not responsible. What does it matter to you now, in any case? What are you hoping for still? If you _have_ a hope left, it is that your suffering air may soften her heart towards you.\u201d",

            "\u201cWhat, Hippolyte? He found it out himself, of course. Why, you have no idea what a cunning little animal he is; dirty little gossip! He has the most extraordinary nose for smelling out other people\u2019s secrets, or anything approaching to scandal. Believe it or not, but I\u2019m pretty sure he has got round Aglaya. If he hasn\u2019t, he soon will. Rogojin is intimate with him, too. How the prince doesn\u2019t notice it, I can\u2019t understand. The little wretch considers me his enemy now and does his best to catch me tripping. What on earth does it matter to him, when he\u2019s dying? However, you\u2019ll see; I shall catch _him_ tripping yet, and not he me.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy did you get him over here, if you hate him so? And is it really worth your while to try to score off him?\u201d",

            "\u201cI thought he might be useful. You know he is in love with Aglaya himself, now, and has written to her; he has even written to Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! he\u2019s not dangerous there!\u201d cried Gania, laughing angrily. \u201cHowever, I believe there is something of that sort in the air; he is very likely to be in love, for he is a mere boy. But he won\u2019t write anonymous letters to the old lady; that would be too audacious a thing for him to attempt; but I dare swear the very first thing he did was to show me up to Aglaya as a base deceiver and intriguer. I confess I was fool enough to attempt something through him at first. I thought he would throw himself into my service out of revengeful feelings towards the prince, the sly little beast! But I know him better now. As for the theft, he may have heard of it from the widow in Petersburg, for if the old man committed himself to such an act, he can have done it for no other object but to give the money to her. Hippolyte said to me, without any prelude, that the general had promised the widow four hundred roubles. Of course I understood, and the little wretch looked at me with a nasty sort of satisfaction. I know him; you may depend upon it he went and told mother too, for the pleasure of wounding her. And why doesn\u2019t he die, I should like to know? He undertook to die within three weeks, and here he is getting fatter. His cough is better, too. It was only yesterday that he said that was the second day he hadn\u2019t coughed blood.\u201d",

            "\u201cI don\u2019t _hate_, I despise him,\u201d said Gania, grandly. \u201cWell, I do hate him, if you like!\u201d he added, with a sudden access of rage, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell him so to his face, even when he\u2019s dying! If you had but read his confession\u2014good Lord! what refinement of impudence! Oh, but I\u2019d have liked to whip him then and there, like a schoolboy, just to see how surprised he would have been! Now he hates everybody because he\u2014Oh, I say, what on earth are they doing there! Listen to that noise! I really can\u2019t stand this any longer. Ptitsin!\u201d he cried, as the latter entered the room, \u201cwhat in the name of goodness are we coming to? Listen to that\u2014\u201d",
            "But the noise came rapidly nearer, the door burst open, and old General Ivolgin, raging, furious, purple-faced, and trembling with anger, rushed in. He was followed by Nina Alexandrovna, Colia, and behind the rest, Hippolyte. "

He could not understand the vagaries of the general, and knew nothing of the last achievement of that worthy, which had caused so much commotion in the house. But he could see that his father had of late changed very much, and that he had begun to behave in so extraordinary a fashion both at home and abroad that he was not like the same man. What perplexed and disturbed him as much as anything was that his father had entirely given up drinking during the last few days. Colia knew that he had quarrelled with both Lebedeff and the prince, and had just bought a small bottle of vodka and brought it home for his father.",

            "\u201cWhat did you mean, sir, that he didn\u2019t exist? Explain yourself,\u201d he repeated, angrily.",
            "\u201cBecause he _didn\u2019t_ exist\u2014never could and never did\u2014there! You\u2019d better drop the subject, I warn you!\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd this is my son\u2014my own son\u2014whom I\u2014oh, gracious Heaven! Eropegoff\u2014Eroshka Eropegoff didn\u2019t exist!\u201d",
            "\u201cHa, ha! it\u2019s Eroshka now,\u201d laughed Hippolyte.",
            "\u201cNo, sir, Kapitoshka\u2014not Eroshka. I mean, Kapiton Alexeyevitch\u2014retired major\u2014married Maria Petrovna Lu\u2014Lu\u2014he was my friend and companion\u2014Lutugoff\u2014from our earliest beginnings. I closed his eyes for him\u2014he was killed. Kapiton Eropegoff never existed! tfu!\u201d",
            "The general shouted in his fury; but it was to be concluded that his wrath was not kindled by the expressed doubt as to Kapiton\u2019s existence. This was his scapegoat; but his excitement was caused by something quite different. As a rule he would have merely shouted down the doubt as to Kapiton, told a long yarn about his friend, and eventually retired upstairs to his room. But today, in the strange uncertainty of human nature, it seemed to require but so small an offence as this to make his cup to overflow. The old man grew purple in the face, he raised his hands. \u201cEnough of this!\u201d he yelled. \u201cMy curse\u2014away, out of the house I go! Colia, bring my bag away!\u201d He left the room hastily and in a paroxysm of rage.",
            "His wife, Colia, and Ptitsin ran out after him.",
            "\u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d said Varia to Gania. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably be making off _there_ again! What a disgrace it all is!\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, he shouldn\u2019t steal,\u201d cried Gania, panting with fury. And just at this moment his eye met Hippolyte\u2019s.",
            "\u201cAs for you, sir,\u201d he cried, \u201cyou should at least remember that you are in a strange house and\u2014receiving hospitality; you should not take the opportunity of tormenting an old man, sir, who is too evidently out of his mind.\u201d",
            "Hippolyte looked furious, but he restrained himself.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t quite agree with you that your father is out of his mind,\u201d he observed, quietly. \u201cOn the contrary, I cannot help thinking he has been less demented of late. Don\u2019t you think so? He has grown so cunning and careful, and weighs his words so deliberately; he spoke to me about that Kapiton fellow with an object, you know! Just fancy\u2014he wanted me to\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, devil take what he wanted you to do! Don\u2019t try to be too cunning with me, young man!\u201d shouted Gania. \u201cIf you are aware of the real reason for my father\u2019s present condition (and you have kept such an excellent spying watch during these last few days that you are sure to be aware of it)\u2014you had no right whatever to torment the\u2014unfortunate man, and to worry my mother by your exaggerations of the affair; because the whole business is nonsense\u2014simply a drunken freak, and nothing more, quite unproved by any evidence, and I don\u2019t believe that much of it!\u201d (he snapped his fingers). \u201cBut you must needs spy and watch over us all, because you are a\u2014a\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cScrew!\u201d laughed Hippolyte.",
            "\u201cBecause you are a humbug, sir; and thought fit to worry people for half an hour, and tried to frighten them into believing that you would shoot yourself with your little empty pistol, pirouetting about and playing at suicide! I gave you hospitality, you have fattened on it, your cough has left you, and you repay all this\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cExcuse me\u2014two words! I am Varvara Ardalionovna\u2019s guest, not yours; _you_ have extended no hospitality to me. On the contrary, if I am not mistaken, I believe you are yourself indebted to Mr. Ptitsin\u2019s hospitality. Four days ago I begged my mother to come down here and find lodgings, because I certainly do feel better here, though I am not fat, nor have I ceased to cough. I am today informed that my room is ready for me; therefore, having thanked your sister and mother for their kindness to me, I intend to leave the house this evening. I beg your pardon\u2014I interrupted you\u2014I think you were about to add something?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh\u2014if that is the state of affairs\u2014\u201d began Gania.",
            "\u201cExcuse me\u2014I will take a seat,\u201d interrupted Hippolyte once more, sitting down deliberately; \u201cfor I am not strong yet. Now then, I am ready to hear you. Especially as this is the last chance we shall have of a talk, and very likely the last meeting we shall ever have at all.\u201d",
            "Gania felt a little guilty.",

            "\u201cI don\u2019t understand your condescension,\u201d said Hippolyte. \u201cAs for me, I promised myself, on the first day of my arrival in this house, that I would have the satisfaction of settling accounts with you in a very thorough manner before I said good-bye to you. I intend to perform this operation now, if you like; after you, though, of course.\u201d",
            "\u201cMay I ask you to be so good as to leave this room?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou\u2019d better speak out. You\u2019ll be sorry afterwards if you don\u2019t.\u201d",
            "\u201cHippolyte, stop, please! It\u2019s so dreadfully undignified,\u201d said Varia.",
            "\u201cWell, only for the sake of a lady,\u201d said Hippolyte, laughing. \u201cI am ready to put off the reckoning, but only put it off, Varvara Ardalionovna, because an explanation between your brother and myself has become an absolute necessity, and I could not think of leaving the house without clearing up all misunderstandings first.\u201d",
            "\u201cIn a word, you are a wretched little scandal-monger,\u201d cried Gania, \u201cand you cannot go away without a scandal!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou see,\u201d said Hippolyte, coolly, \u201cyou can\u2019t restrain yourself. You\u2019ll be dreadfully sorry afterwards if you don\u2019t speak out now. Come, you shall have the first say. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d",
            "Gania was silent and merely looked contemptuously at him.",
            "\u201cYou won\u2019t? Very well. I shall be as short as possible, for my part. Two or three times to-day I have had the word \u2018hospitality\u2019 pushed down my throat; this is not fair. In inviting me here you yourself entrapped me for your own use; you thought I wished to revenge myself upon the prince. You heard that Aglaya Ivanovna had been kind to me and read my confession. Making sure that I should give myself up to your interests, you hoped that you might get some assistance out of me. I will not go into details. I don\u2019t ask either admission or confirmation of this from yourself; I am quite content to leave you to your conscience, and to feel that we understand one another capitally.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat a history you are weaving out of the most ordinary circumstances!\u201d cried Varia.",
            "\u201cI told you the fellow was nothing but a scandal-monger,\u201d said Gania.",
            "\u201cExcuse me, Varia Ardalionovna, I will proceed. I can, of course, neither love nor respect the prince, though he is a good-hearted fellow, if a little queer. But there is no need whatever for me to hate him. I quite understood your brother when he first offered me aid against the prince, though I did not show it; I knew well that your brother was making a ridiculous mistake in me. I am ready to spare him, however, even now; but solely out of respect for yourself, Varvara Ardalionovna.",
            "\u201cHaving now shown you that I am not quite such a fool as I look, and that I have to be fished for with a rod and line for a good long while before I am caught, I will proceed to explain why I specially wished to make your brother look a fool. That my motive power is hate, I do not attempt to conceal. I have felt that before dying (and I am dying, however much fatter I may appear to you), I must absolutely make a fool of, at least, one of that class of men which has dogged me all my life, which I hate so cordially, and which is so prominently represented by your much esteemed brother. I should not enjoy paradise nearly so much without having done this first. I hate you, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, solely (this may seem curious to you, but I repeat)\u2014solely because you are the type, and incarnation, and head, and crown of the most impudent, the most self-satisfied, the most vulgar and detestable form of commonplaceness. You are ordinary of the ordinary; you have no chance of ever fathering the pettiest idea of your own. And yet you are as jealous and conceited as you can possibly be; you consider yourself a great genius; of this you are persuaded, although there are dark moments of doubt and rage, when even this fact seems uncertain. There are spots of darkness on your horizon, though they will disappear when you become completely stupid. But a long and chequered path lies before you, and of this I am glad. In the first place you will never gain a certain person.\u201d",
            "\u201cCome, come! This is intolerable! You had better stop, you little mischief-making wretch!\u201d cried Varia. Gania had grown very pale; he trembled, but said nothing.",
            "Hippolyte paused, and looked at him intently and with great gratification. He then turned his gaze upon Varia, bowed, and went out, without adding another word.",
            "Gania might justly complain of the hardness with which fate treated him. Varia dared not speak to him for a long while, as he strode past her, backwards and forwards. At last he went and stood at the window, looking out, with his back turned towards her. There was a fearful row going on upstairs again.",
            "\u201cAre you off?\u201d said Gania, suddenly, remarking that she had risen and was about to leave the room. \u201cWait a moment\u2014look at this.\u201d",
            "He approached the table and laid a small sheet of paper before her. It looked like a little note.",
            "\u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried Varia, raising her hands.",
            "This was the note:",
            "\u201cGAVRILA ARDOLIONOVITCH,\u2014persuaded of your kindness of heart, I have determined to ask your advice on a matter of great importance to myself. I should like to meet you tomorrow morning at seven o\u2019clock by the green bench in the park. It is not far from our house. Varvara Ardalionovna, who must accompany you, knows the place well.",
            " \u201cA. E.\u201d",
            " \u201cWhat on earth is one to make of a girl like that?\u201d said Varia.",
            "Gania, little as he felt inclined for swagger at this moment, could not avoid showing his triumph, especially just after such humiliating remarks as those of Hippolyte. A smile of self-satisfaction beamed on his face, and Varia too was brimming over with delight.",
            "\u201cAnd this is the very day that they were to announce the engagement! What will she do next?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat do you suppose she wants to talk about tomorrow?\u201d asked Gania.",
            "\u201cOh, _that\u2019s_ all the same! The chief thing is that she wants to see you after six months\u2019 absence. Look here, Gania, this is a _serious_ business. Don\u2019t swagger again and lose the game\u2014play carefully, but don\u2019t funk, do you understand? As if she could possibly avoid seeing what I have been working for all this last six months! And just imagine, I was there this morning and not a word of this! I was there, you know, on the sly. The old lady did not know, or she would have kicked me out. I ran some risk for you, you see. I did so want to find out, at all hazards.\u201d",
            "Here there was a frantic noise upstairs once more; several people seemed to be rushing downstairs at once.",
            "\u201cNow, Gania,\u201d cried Varia, frightened, \u201cwe can\u2019t let him go out! We can\u2019t afford to have a breath of scandal about the town at this moment. Run after him and beg his pardon\u2014quick.\u201d",
            "But the father of the family was out in the road already. Colia was carrying his bag for him; Nina Alexandrovna stood and cried on the doorstep; she wanted to run after the general, but Ptitsin kept her back.",
            "\u201cYou will only excite him more,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has nowhere else to go to\u2014he\u2019ll be back here in half an hour. I\u2019ve talked it all over with Colia; let him play the fool a bit, it will do him good.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat are you up to? Where are you off to? You\u2019ve nowhere to go to, you know,\u201d cried Gania, out of the window.",
            "\u201cCome back, father; the neighbours will hear!\u201d cried Varia.",
            "The general stopped, turned round, raised his hands and remarked: \u201cMy curse be upon this house!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhich observation should always be made in as theatrical a tone as possible,\u201d muttered Gania, shutting the window with a bang.",
            "The neighbours undoubtedly did hear. Varia rushed out of the room.",
            "No sooner had his sister left him alone, than Gania took the note out of his pocket, kissed it, and pirouetted around. "

        "III.": [
            "But on this occasion there was something more serious than usual. Everyone seemed to know something, but to be afraid to talk about it.",
            "The general had turned up in the bosom of his family two or three days before, but not, as usual, with the olive branch of peace in his hand, not in the garb of penitence\u2014in which he was usually clad on such occasions\u2014but, on the contrary, in an uncommonly bad temper. He had arrived in a quarrelsome mood, pitching into everyone he came across, and talking about all sorts and kinds of subjects in the most unexpected manner, so that it was impossible to discover what it was that was really putting him out. At moments he would be apparently quite bright and happy; but as a rule he would sit moody and thoughtful. He would abruptly commence to hold forth about the Epanchins, about Lebedeff, or the prince, and equally abruptly would stop short and refuse to speak another word, answering all further questions with a stupid smile, unconscious that he was smiling, or that he had been asked a question. The whole of the previous night he had spent tossing about and groaning, and poor Nina Alexandrovna had been busy making cold compresses and warm fomentations and so on, without being very clear how to apply them. He had fallen asleep after a while, but not for long, and had awaked in a state of violent hypochondria which had ended in his quarrel with Hippolyte, and the solemn cursing of Ptitsin\u2019s establishment generally. It was also observed during those two or three days that he was in a state of morbid self-esteem, and was specially touchy on all points of honour. Colia insisted, in discussing the matter with his mother, that all this was but the outcome of abstinence from drink, or perhaps of pining after Lebedeff, with whom up to this time the general had been upon terms of the greatest friendship; but with whom, for some reason or other, he had quarrelled a few days since, parting from him in great wrath. There had also been a scene with the prince. Colia had asked an explanation of the latter, but had been forced to conclude that he was not told the whole truth.",
            "If Hippolyte and Nina Alexandrovna had, as Gania suspected, had some special conversation about the general\u2019s actions, it was strange that the malicious youth, whom Gania had called a scandal-monger to his face, had not allowed himself a similar satisfaction with Colia.",
            "The fact is that probably Hippolyte was not quite so black as Gania painted him; and it was hardly likely that he had informed Nina Alexandrovna of certain events, of which we know, for the mere pleasure of giving her pain. We must never forget that human motives are generally far more complicated than we are apt to suppose, and that we can very rarely accurately describe the motives of another. It is much better for the writer, as a rule, to content himself with the bare statement of events; and we shall take this line with regard to the catastrophe recorded above, and shall state the remaining events connected with the general\u2019s trouble shortly, because we feel that we have already given to this secondary character in our story more attention than we originally intended.",
            "The course of events had marched in the following order. When Lebedeff returned, in company with the general, after their expedition to town a few days since, for the purpose of investigation, he brought the prince no information whatever. If the latter had not himself been occupied with other thoughts and impressions at the time, he must have observed that Lebedeff not only was very uncommunicative, but even appeared anxious to avoid him.",
            "When the prince did give the matter a little attention, he recalled the fact that during these days he had always found Lebedeff to be in radiantly good spirits, when they happened to meet; and further, that the general and Lebedeff were always together. The two friends did not seem ever to be parted for a moment.",
            "Occasionally the prince heard loud talking and laughing upstairs, and once he detected the sound of a jolly soldier\u2019s song going on above, and recognized the unmistakable bass of the general\u2019s voice. But the sudden outbreak of song did not last; and for an hour afterwards the animated sound of apparently drunken conversation continued to be heard from above. At length there was the clearest evidence of a grand mutual embracing, and someone burst into tears. Shortly after this, however, there was a violent but short-lived quarrel, with loud talking on both sides.",
            "All these days Colia had been in a state of great mental preoccupation. Muishkin was usually out all day, and only came home late at night. On his return he was invariably informed that Colia had been looking for him. However, when they did meet, Colia never had anything particular to tell him, excepting that he was highly dissatisfied with the general and his present condition of mind and behaviour.",
            "\u201cThey drag each other about the place,\u201d he said, \u201cand get drunk together at the pub close by here, and quarrel in the street on the way home, and embrace one another after it, and don\u2019t seem to part for a moment.\u201d",
            "When the prince pointed out that there was nothing new about that, for that they had always behaved in this manner together, Colia did not know what to say; in fact he could not explain what it was that specially worried him, just now, about his father.",
            "On the morning following the bacchanalian songs and quarrels recorded above, as the prince stepped out of the house at about eleven o\u2019clock, the general suddenly appeared before him, much agitated.",
            "\u201cI have long sought the honour and opportunity of meeting you\u2014much-esteemed Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d he murmured, pressing the prince\u2019s hand very hard, almost painfully so; \u201clong\u2014very long.\u201d",
            "The prince begged him to step in and sit down.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014I will not sit down,\u2014I am keeping you, I see,\u2014another time!\u2014I think I may be permitted to congratulate you upon the realization of your heart\u2019s best wishes, is it not so?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat best wishes?\u201d",
            "The prince blushed. He thought, as so many in his position do, that nobody had seen, heard, noticed, or understood anything.",
            "\u201cOh\u2014be easy, sir, be easy! I shall not wound your tenderest feelings. I\u2019ve been through it all myself, and I know well how unpleasant it is when an outsider sticks his nose in where he is not wanted. I experience this every morning. I came to speak to you about another matter, though, an important matter. A very important matter, prince.\u201d",
            "The latter requested him to take a seat once more, and sat down himself.",
            "\u201cWell\u2014just for one second, then. The fact is, I came for advice. Of course I live now without any very practical objects in life; but, being full of self-respect, in which quality the ordinary Russian is so deficient as a rule, and of activity, I am desirous, in a word, prince, of placing myself and my wife and children in a position of\u2014in fact, I want advice.\u201d",
            "The prince commended his aspirations with warmth.",
            "\u201cQuite so\u2014quite so! But this is all mere nonsense. I came here to speak of something quite different, something very important, prince. And I have determined to come to you as to a man in whose sincerity and nobility of feeling I can trust like\u2014like\u2014are you surprised at my words, prince?\u201d",
            "The prince was watching his guest, if not with much surprise, at all events with great attention and curiosity.",
            "The old man was very pale; every now and then his lips trembled, and his hands seemed unable to rest quietly, but continually moved from place to place. He had twice already jumped up from his chair and sat down again without being in the least aware of it. He would take up a book from the table and open it\u2014talking all the while,\u2014look at the heading of a chapter, shut it and put it back again, seizing another immediately, but holding it unopened in his hand, and waving it in the air as he spoke.",
            "\u201cBut enough!\u201d he cried, suddenly. \u201cI see I have been boring you with my\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNot in the least\u2014not in the least, I assure you. On the contrary, I am listening most attentively, and am anxious to guess\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cPrince, I wish to place myself in a respectable position\u2014I wish to esteem myself\u2014and to\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cMy dear sir, a man of such noble aspirations is worthy of all esteem by virtue of those aspirations alone.\u201d",
            "The prince brought out his \u201ccopy-book sentence\u201d in the firm belief that it would produce a good effect. He felt instinctively that some such well-sounding humbug, brought out at the proper moment, would soothe the old man\u2019s feelings, and would be specially acceptable to such a man in such a position. At all hazards, his guest must be despatched with heart relieved and spirit comforted; that was the problem before the prince at this moment.",
            "The phrase flattered the general, touched him, and pleased him mightily. He immediately changed his tone, and started off on a long and solemn explanation. But listen as he would, the prince could make neither head nor tail of it.",
            "The general spoke hotly and quickly for ten minutes; he spoke as though his words could not keep pace with his crowding thoughts. Tears stood in his eyes, and yet his speech was nothing but a collection of disconnected sentences, without beginning and without end\u2014a string of unexpected words and unexpected sentiments\u2014colliding with one another, and jumping over one another, as they burst from his lips.",
            "\u201cEnough!\u201d he concluded at last, \u201cyou understand me, and that is the great thing. A heart like yours cannot help understanding the sufferings of another. Prince, you are the ideal of generosity; what are other men beside yourself? But you are young\u2014accept my blessing! My principal object is to beg you to fix an hour for a most important conversation\u2014that is my great hope, prince. My heart needs but a little friendship and sympathy, and yet I cannot always find means to satisfy it.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut why not now? I am ready to listen, and\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no\u2014prince, not now! Now is a dream! And it is too, too important! It is to be the hour of Fate to me\u2014_my own_ hour. Our interview is not to be broken in upon by every chance comer, every impertinent guest\u2014and there are plenty of such stupid, impertinent fellows\u201d\u2014(he bent over and whispered mysteriously, with a funny, frightened look on his face)\u2014\u201cwho are unworthy to tie your shoe, prince. I don\u2019t say _mine_, mind\u2014you will understand me, prince. Only _you_ understand me, prince\u2014no one else. _He_ doesn\u2019t understand me, he is absolutely\u2014_absolutely_ unable to sympathize. The first qualification for understanding another is Heart.\u201d",
            "The prince was rather alarmed at all this, and was obliged to end by appointing the same hour of the following day for the interview desired. The general left him much comforted and far less agitated than when he had arrived.",
            "At seven in the evening, the prince sent to request Lebedeff to pay him a visit. Lebedeff came at once, and \u201cesteemed it an honour,\u201d as he observed, the instant he entered the room. He acted as though there had never been the slightest suspicion of the fact that he had systematically avoided the prince for the last three days.",
            "He sat down on the edge of his chair, smiling and making faces, and rubbing his hands, and looking as though he were in delighted expectation of hearing some important communication, which had been long guessed by all.",
            "The prince was instantly covered with confusion; for it appeared to be plain that everyone expected something of him\u2014that everyone looked at him as though anxious to congratulate him, and greeted him with hints, and smiles, and knowing looks.",
            "Keller, for instance, had run into the house three times of late, \u201cjust for a moment,\u201d and each time with the air of desiring to offer his congratulations. Colia, too, in spite of his melancholy, had once or twice begun sentences in much the same strain of suggestion or insinuation.",
            "The prince, however, immediately began, with some show of annoyance, to question Lebedeff categorically, as to the general\u2019s present condition, and his opinion thereon. He described the morning\u2019s interview in a few words.",
            "\u201cEveryone has his worries, prince, especially in these strange and troublous times of ours,\u201d Lebedeff replied, drily, and with the air of a man disappointed of his reasonable expectations.",
            "\u201cDear me, what a philosopher you are!\u201d laughed the prince.",
            "\u201cPhilosophy is necessary, sir\u2014very necessary\u2014in our day. It is too much neglected. As for me, much esteemed prince, I am sensible of having experienced the honour of your confidence in a certain matter up to a certain point, but never beyond that point. I do not for a moment complain\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cLebedeff, you seem to be angry for some reason!\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cNot the least bit in the world, esteemed and revered prince! Not the least bit in the world!\u201d cried Lebedeff, solemnly, with his hand upon his heart. \u201cOn the contrary, I am too painfully aware that neither by my position in the world, nor by my gifts of intellect and heart, nor by my riches, nor by any former conduct of mine, have I in any way deserved your confidence, which is far above my highest aspirations and hopes. Oh no, prince; I may serve you, but only as your humble slave! I am not angry, oh no! Not angry; pained perhaps, but nothing more.",
            "\u201cMy dear Lebedeff, I\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, nothing more, nothing more! I was saying to myself but now... \u2018I am quite unworthy of friendly relations with him,\u2019 say I; \u2018but perhaps as landlord of this house I may, at some future date, in his good time, receive information as to certain imminent and much to be desired changes\u2014\u2019\u201d",
            "So saying Lebedeff fixed the prince with his sharp little eyes, still in hope that he would get his curiosity satisfied.",
            "The prince looked back at him in amazement.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you are driving at!\u201d he cried, almost angrily, \u201cand, and\u2014what an intriguer you are, Lebedeff!\u201d he added, bursting into a fit of genuine laughter.",
            "Lebedeff followed suit at once, and it was clear from his radiant face that he considered his prospects of satisfaction immensely improved.",
            "\u201cAnd do you know,\u201d the prince continued, \u201cI am amazed at your naive ways, Lebedeff! Don\u2019t be angry with me\u2014not only yours, everybody else\u2019s also! You are waiting to hear something from me at this very moment with such simplicity that I declare I feel quite ashamed of myself for having nothing whatever to tell you. I swear to you solemnly, that there is nothing to tell. There! Can you take that in?\u201d The prince laughed again.",
            "Lebedeff assumed an air of dignity. It was true enough that he was sometimes naive to a degree in his curiosity; but he was also an excessively cunning gentleman, and the prince was almost converting him into an enemy by his repeated rebuffs. The prince did not snub Lebedeff\u2019s curiosity, however, because he felt any contempt for him; but simply because the subject was too delicate to talk about. Only a few days before he had looked upon his own dreams almost as crimes. But Lebedeff considered the refusal as caused by personal dislike to himself, and was hurt accordingly. Indeed, there was at this moment a piece of news, most interesting to the prince, which Lebedeff knew and even had wished to tell him, but which he now kept obstinately to himself.",
            "\u201cAnd what can I do for you, esteemed prince? Since I am told you sent for me just now,\u201d he said, after a few moments\u2019 silence.",
            "\u201cOh, it was about the general,\u201d began the prince, waking abruptly from the fit of musing which he too had indulged in \u201cand\u2014and about the theft you told me of.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is\u2014er\u2014about\u2014what theft?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh come! just as if you didn\u2019t understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch! What are you up to? I can\u2019t make you out! The money, the money, sir! The four hundred roubles that you lost that day. You came and told me about it one morning, and then went off to Petersburg. There, _now_ do you understand?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh\u2014h\u2014h! You mean the four hundred roubles!\u201d said Lebedeff, dragging the words out, just as though it had only just dawned upon him what the prince was talking about. \u201cThanks very much, prince, for your kind interest\u2014you do me too much honour. I found the money, long ago!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou found it? Thank God for that!\u201d",
            "\u201cYour exclamation proves the generous sympathy of your nature, prince; for four hundred roubles\u2014to a struggling family man like myself\u2014is no small matter!\u201d",
            "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that; at least, of course, I\u2019m glad for your sake, too,\u201d added the prince, correcting himself, \u201cbut\u2014how did you find it?\u201d",
            "\u201cVery simply indeed! I found it under the chair upon which my coat had hung; so that it is clear the purse simply fell out of the pocket and on to the floor!\u201d",
            "\u201cUnder the chair? Impossible! Why, you told me yourself that you had searched every corner of the room? How could you not have looked in the most likely place of all?\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course I looked there,\u2014of course I did! Very much so! I looked and scrambled about, and felt for it, and wouldn\u2019t believe it was not there, and looked again and again. It is always so in such cases. One longs and expects to find a lost article; one sees it is not there, and the place is as bare as one\u2019s palm; and yet one returns and looks again and again, fifteen or twenty times, likely enough!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, quite so, of course. But how was it in your case?\u2014I don\u2019t quite understand,\u201d said the bewildered prince. \u201cYou say it wasn\u2019t there at first, and that you searched the place thoroughly, and yet it turned up on that very spot!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, sir\u2014on that very spot.\u201d The prince gazed strangely at Lebedeff. \u201cAnd the general?\u201d he asked, abruptly.",
            "\u201cThe\u2014the general? How do you mean, the general?\u201d said Lebedeff, dubiously, as though he had not taken in the drift of the prince\u2019s remark.",
            "\u201cOh, good heavens! I mean, what did the general say when the purse turned up under the chair? You and he had searched for it together there, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so\u2014together! But the second time I thought better to say nothing about finding it. I found it alone.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut\u2014why in the world\u2014and the money? Was it all there?\u201d",
            "\u201cI opened the purse and counted it myself; right to a single rouble.\u201d",
            "\u201cI think you might have come and told me,\u201d said the prince, thoughtfully.",
            "\u201cOh\u2014I didn\u2019t like to disturb you, prince, in the midst of your private and doubtless most interesting personal reflections. Besides, I wanted to appear, myself, to have found nothing. I took the purse, and opened it, and counted the money, and shut it and put it down again under the chair.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat in the world for?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, just out of curiosity,\u201d said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and sniggering.",
            "\u201cWhat, it\u2019s still there then, is it? Ever since the day before yesterday?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh no! You see, I was half in hopes the general might find it. Because if I found it, why should not he too observe an object lying before his very eyes? I moved the chair several times so as to expose the purse to view, but the general never saw it. He is very absent just now, evidently. He talks and laughs and tells stories, and suddenly flies into a rage with me, goodness knows why.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, but\u2014have you taken the purse away now?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, it disappeared from under the chair in the night.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere is it now, then?\u201d",
            "\u201cHere,\u201d laughed Lebedeff, at last, rising to his full height and looking pleasantly at the prince, \u201chere, in the lining of my coat. Look, you can feel it for yourself, if you like!\u201d",
            "Sure enough there was something sticking out of the front of the coat\u2014something large. It certainly felt as though it might well be the purse fallen through a hole in the pocket into the lining.",
            "\u201cI took it out and had a look at it; it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ve let it slip back into the lining now, as you see, and so I have been walking about ever since yesterday morning; it knocks against my legs when I walk along.\u201d",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! and you take no notice of it?\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so, I take no notice of it. Ha, ha! and think of this, prince, my pockets are always strong and whole, and yet, here in one night, is a huge hole. I know the phenomenon is unworthy of your notice; but such is the case. I examined the hole, and I declare it actually looks as though it had been made with a pen-knife, a most improbable contingency.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd\u2014and\u2014the general?\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, very angry all day, sir; all yesterday and all today. He shows decided bacchanalian predilections at one time, and at another is tearful and sensitive, but at any moment he is liable to paroxysms of such rage that I assure you, prince, I am quite alarmed. I am not a military man, you know. Yesterday we were sitting together in the tavern, and the lining of my coat was\u2014quite accidentally, of course\u2014sticking out right in front. The general squinted at it, and flew into a rage. He never looks me quite in the face now, unless he is very drunk or maudlin; but yesterday he looked at me in such a way that a shiver went all down my back. I intend to find the purse tomorrow; but till then I am going to have another night of it with him.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of tormenting him like this?\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t torment him, prince, I don\u2019t indeed!\u201d cried Lebedeff, hotly. \u201cI love him, my dear sir, I esteem him; and believe it or not, I love him all the better for this business, yes\u2014and value him more.\u201d",
            "Lebedeff said this so seriously that the prince quite lost his temper with him.",
            "\u201cNonsense! love him and torment him so! Why, by the very fact that he put the purse prominently before you, first under the chair and then in your lining, he shows that he does not wish to deceive you, but is anxious to beg your forgiveness in this artless way. Do you hear? He is asking your pardon. He confides in the delicacy of your feelings, and in your friendship for him. And you can allow yourself to humiliate so thoroughly honest a man!\u201d",
            "\u201cThoroughly honest, quite so, prince, thoroughly honest!\u201d said Lebedeff, with flashing eyes. \u201cAnd only you, prince, could have found so very appropriate an expression. I honour you for it, prince. Very well, that\u2019s settled; I shall find the purse now and not tomorrow. Here, I find it and take it out before your eyes! And the money is all right. Take it, prince, and keep it till tomorrow, will you? Tomorrow or next day I\u2019ll take it back again. I think, prince, that the night after its disappearance it was buried under a bush in the garden. So I believe\u2014what do you think of that?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, take care you don\u2019t tell him to his face that you have found the purse. Simply let him see that it is no longer in the lining of your coat, and form his own conclusions.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you think so? Had I not just better tell him I have found it, and pretend I never guessed where it was?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said the prince, thoughtfully; \u201cit\u2019s too late for that\u2014that would be dangerous now. No, no! Better say nothing about it. Be nice with him, you know, but don\u2019t show him\u2014oh, _you_ know well enough\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI know, prince, of course I know, but I\u2019m afraid I shall not carry it out; for to do so one needs a heart like your own. He is so very irritable just now, and so proud. At one moment he will embrace me, and the next he flies out at me and sneers at me, and then I stick the lining forward on purpose. Well, _au revoir_, prince, I see I am keeping you, and boring you, too, interfering with your most interesting private reflections.\u201d",
            "\u201cNow, do be careful! Secrecy, as before!\u201d",

His calmness, however, was more apparent than real. He was courteous, but there was a suggestion of injured innocence in his manner.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve brought your book back,\u201d he began, indicating a book lying on the table. \u201cMuch obliged to you for lending it to me.\u201d",
            "\u201cAh, yes. Well, did you read it, general? It\u2019s curious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the prince, delighted to be able to open up conversation upon an outside subject.",

As to the evidence of eye-witnesses, in these days people prefer impudent lies to the stories of men of worth and long service.

This person was quite unworthy of the gift.\u201d",

I am not dependent upon his hospitality, and upon his house; I have my own family. I do not attempt to justify my own weakness. I have drunk with this man, and perhaps I deplore the fact now, but I did not take him up for the sake of drink alone (excuse the crudeness of the expression, prince); I did not make friends with him for that alone. I was attracted by his good qualities; but when the fellow declares that he was a child in 1812, and had his left leg cut off, and buried in the Vagarkoff cemetery, in Moscow, such a cock-and-bull story amounts to disrespect, my dear sir, to\u2014to impudent exaggeration.\u201d",

Some people lie, if you like to put it so, out of pure friendship, in order to amuse their fellows; but when a man makes use of extravagance in order to show his disrespect and to make clear how the intimacy bores him, it is time for a man of honour to break off the said intimacy, and to teach the offender his place.\u201d",

He says he picked his own leg up and took it away and buried it in the cemetery. He swore he had a stone put up over it with the inscription: \u2018Here lies the leg of Collegiate Secretary Lebedeff,\u2019 and on the other side, \u2018Rest, beloved ashes, till the morn of joy,\u2019 and that he has a service read over it every year (which is simply sacrilege), and goes to Moscow once a year on purpose. He invites me to Moscow in order to prove his assertion, and show me his leg\u2019s tomb, and the very cannon that shot him; he says it\u2019s the eleventh from the gate of the Kremlin, an old-fashioned falconet taken from the French afterwards.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd, meanwhile both his legs are still on his body,\u201d said the prince, laughing. \u201cI assure you, it is only an innocent joke, and you need not be angry about it.\u201d",

Had I been fifteen years old I should probably have been terribly frightened when the French arrived, as my mother was (who had been too slow about clearing out of Moscow); but as I was only just ten I was not in the least alarmed, and rushed through the crowd to the very door of the palace when Napoleon alighted from his horse.\u201d",

But if some writer had invented it, all the critics would have jumped down his throat and said the thing was too improbable for anything. And yet you read it in the paper, and you can\u2019t help thinking that out of these strange disclosures is to be gained the full knowledge of Russian life and character. You said that well, general; it is so true,\u201d concluded the prince, warmly, delighted to have found a refuge from the fiery blushes which had covered his face.",

The world was full of his name; I\u2014so to speak\u2014drew it in with my mother\u2019s milk. Napoleon, passing a couple of paces from me, caught sight of me accidentally. I was very well dressed, and being all alone, in that crowd, as you will easily imagine...\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, of course! Naturally the sight impressed him, and proved to him that not _all_ the aristocracy had left Moscow; that at least some nobles and their children had remained behind.\u201d",
            "\u201cJust so! just so! He wanted to win over the aristocracy! When his eagle eye fell on me, mine probably flashed back in response. \u2018_Voil\u00e0 un gar\u00e7on bien \u00e9veill\u00e9! Qui est ton p\u00e8re?_\u2019 I immediately replied, almost panting with excitement, \u2018A general, who died on the battle-fields of his country!\u2019 \u2018_Le fils d\u2019un boyard et d\u2019un brave, pardessus le march\u00e9. J\u2019aime les boyards. M\u2019aimes-tu, petit?_\u2019",
            "\u201cTo this keen question I replied as keenly, \u2018The Russian heart can recognize a great man even in the bitter enemy of his country.\u2019 At least, I don\u2019t remember the exact words, you know, but the idea was as I say. Napoleon was struck; he thought a minute and then said to his suite: \u2018I like that boy\u2019s pride; if all Russians think like this child, then\u2014\u2019 he didn\u2019t finish, but went on and entered the palace. I instantly mixed with his suite, and followed him. I was already in high favour. I remember when he came into the first hall, the emperor stopped before a portrait of the Empress Katherine, and after a thoughtful glance remarked, \u2018That was a great woman,\u2019 and passed on.",
            "\u201cWell, in a couple of days I was known all over the palace and the Kremlin as \u2018le petit boyard.\u2019 I only went home to sleep. They were nearly out of their minds about me at home. A couple of days after this, Napoleon\u2019s page, De Bazancour, died; he had not been able to stand the trials of the campaign. Napoleon remembered me; I was taken away without explanation; the dead page\u2019s uniform was tried on me, and when I was taken before the emperor, dressed in it, he nodded his head to me, and I was told that I was appointed to the vacant post of page.",
            "\u201cWell, I was glad enough, for I had long felt the greatest sympathy for this man; and then the pretty uniform and all that\u2014only a child, you know\u2014and so on. It was a dark green dress coat with gold buttons\u2014red facings, white trousers, and a white silk waistcoat\u2014silk stockings, shoes with buckles, and top-boots if I were riding out with his majesty or with the suite.",
            "\u201cThough the position of all of us at that time was not particularly brilliant, and the poverty was dreadful all round, yet the etiquette at court was strictly preserved, and the more strictly in proportion to the growth of the forebodings of disaster.\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so, quite so, of course!\u201d murmured the poor prince, who didn\u2019t know where to look. \u201cYour memoirs would be most interesting.\u201d",
            "The general was, of course, repeating what he had told Lebedeff the night before, and thus brought it out glibly enough, but here he looked suspiciously at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.",
            "\u201cMy memoirs!\u201d he began, with redoubled pride and dignity. \u201cWrite my memoirs? The idea has not tempted me. And yet, if you please, my memoirs have long been written, but they shall not see the light until dust returns to dust. Then, I doubt not, they will be translated into all languages, not of course on account of their actual literary merit, but because of the great events of which I was the actual witness, though but a child at the time. As a child, I was able to penetrate into the secrecy of the great man\u2019s private room. At nights I have heard the groans and wailings of this \u2018giant in distress.\u2019 He could feel no shame in weeping before such a mere child as I was, though I understood even then that the reason for his suffering was the silence of the Emperor Alexander.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, of course; he had written letters to the latter with proposals of peace, had he not?\u201d put in the prince.",
            "\u201cWe did not know the details of his proposals, but he wrote letter after letter, all day and every day. He was dreadfully agitated. Sometimes at night I would throw myself upon his breast with tears (Oh, how I loved that man!). \u2018Ask forgiveness, Oh, ask forgiveness of the Emperor Alexander!\u2019 I would cry. I should have said, of course, \u2018Make peace with Alexander,\u2019 but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way recorded. \u2018Oh, my child,\u2019 he would say (he loved to talk to me and seemed to forget my tender years), \u2018Oh, my child, I am ready to kiss Alexander\u2019s feet, but I hate and abominate the King of Prussia and the Austrian Emperor, and\u2014and\u2014but you know nothing of politics, my child.\u2019 He would pull up, remembering whom he was speaking to, but his eyes would sparkle for a long while after this. Well now, if I were to describe all this, and I have seen greater events than these, all these critical gentlemen of the press and political parties\u2014Oh, no thanks! I\u2019m their very humble servant, but no thanks!\u201d",
            "\u201cQuite so\u2014parties\u2014you are very right,\u201d said the prince. \u201cI was reading a book about Napoleon and the Waterloo campaign only the other day, by Charasse, in which the author does not attempt to conceal his joy at Napoleon\u2019s discomfiture at every page. Well now, I don\u2019t like that; it smells of \u2018party,\u2019 you know. You are quite right. And were you much occupied with your service under Napoleon?\u201d",
            "The general was in ecstasies, for the prince\u2019s remarks, made, as they evidently were, in all seriousness and simplicity, quite dissipated the last relics of his suspicion.",
            "\u201cI know Charasse\u2019s book! Oh! I was so angry with his work! I wrote to him and said\u2014I forget what, at this moment. You ask whether I was very busy under the Emperor? Oh no! I was called \u2018page,\u2019 but hardly took my duty seriously. Besides, Napoleon very soon lost hope of conciliating the Russians, and he would have forgotten all about me had he not loved me\u2014for personal reasons\u2014I don\u2019t mind saying so now. My heart was greatly drawn to him, too. My duties were light. I merely had to be at the palace occasionally to escort the Emperor out riding, and that was about all. I rode very fairly well. He used to have a ride before dinner, and his suite on those occasions were generally Davoust, myself, and Roustan.\u201d",
            "\u201cConstant?\u201d said the prince, suddenly, and quite involuntarily.",
            "\u201cNo; Constant was away then, taking a letter to the Empress Josephine. Instead of him there were always a couple of orderlies\u2014and that was all, excepting, of course, the generals and marshals whom Napoleon always took with him for the inspection of various localities, and for the sake of consultation generally. I remember there was one\u2014Davoust\u2014nearly always with him\u2014a big man with spectacles. They used to argue and quarrel sometimes. Once they were in the Emperor\u2019s study together\u2014just those two and myself\u2014I was unobserved\u2014and they argued, and the Emperor seemed to be agreeing to something under protest. Suddenly his eye fell on me and an idea seemed to flash across him.",
            "\u201c\u2018Child,\u2019 he said, abruptly. \u2018If I were to recognize the Russian orthodox religion and emancipate the serfs, do you think Russia would come over to me?\u2019\u201d",
            "\u201c\u2018Never!\u2019 I cried, indignantly.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe Emperor was much struck.\u201d",
            "\u201c\u2018In the flashing eyes of this patriotic child I read and accept the fiat of the Russian people. Enough, Davoust, it is mere phantasy on our part. Come, let\u2019s hear your other project.\u2019\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, but that was a great idea,\u201d said the prince, clearly interested. \u201cYou ascribe it to Davoust, do you?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, at all events, they were consulting together at the time. Of course it was the idea of an eagle, and must have originated with Napoleon; but the other project was good too\u2014it was the \u2018Conseil du lion!\u2019 as Napoleon called it. This project consisted in a proposal to occupy the Kremlin with the whole army; to arm and fortify it scientifically, to kill as many horses as could be got, and salt their flesh, and spend the winter there; and in spring to fight their way out. Napoleon liked the idea\u2014it attracted him. We rode round the Kremlin walls every day, and Napoleon used to give orders where they were to be patched, where built up, where pulled down and so on. All was decided at last. They were alone together\u2014those two and myself.",
            "\u201cNapoleon was walking up and down with folded arms. I could not take my eyes off his face\u2014my heart beat loudly and painfully.",
            "\u201c\u2018I\u2019m off,\u2019 said Davoust. \u2018Where to?\u2019 asked Napoleon.",
            "\u201c\u2018To salt horse-flesh,\u2019 said Davoust. Napoleon shuddered\u2014his fate was being decided.",
            "\u201c\u2018Child,\u2019 he addressed me suddenly, \u2018what do you think of our plan?\u2019 Of course he only applied to me as a sort of toss-up, you know. I turned to Davoust and addressed my reply to him. I said, as though inspired:",
            "\u201c\u2018Escape, general! Go home!\u2014\u2019",
            "\u201cThe project was abandoned; Davoust shrugged his shoulders and went out, whispering to himself\u2014\u2018_Bah, il devient superstitieux!_\u2019 Next morning the order to retreat was given.\u201d",
            "\u201cAll this is most interesting,\u201d said the prince, very softly, \u201cif it really was so\u2014that is, I mean\u2014\u201d he hastened to correct himself.",
            "\u201cOh, my dear prince,\u201d cried the general, who was now so intoxicated with his own narrative that he probably could not have pulled up at the most patent indiscretion. \u201cYou say, \u2018if it really was so!\u2019 There was more\u2014_much_ more, I assure you! These are merely a few little political acts. I tell you I was the eye-witness of the nightly sorrow and groanings of the great man, and of _that_ no one can speak but myself. Towards the end he wept no more, though he continued to emit an occasional groan; but his face grew more overcast day by day, as though Eternity were wrapping its gloomy mantle about him. Occasionally we passed whole hours of silence together at night, Roustan snoring in the next room\u2014that fellow slept like a pig. \u2018But he\u2019s loyal to me and my dynasty,\u2019 said Napoleon of him.",
            "\u201cSometimes it was very painful to me, and once he caught me with tears in my eyes. He looked at me kindly. \u2018You are sorry for me,\u2019 he said, \u2018you, my child, and perhaps one other child\u2014my son, the King of Rome\u2014may grieve for me. All the rest hate me; and my brothers are the first to betray me in misfortune.\u2019 I sobbed and threw myself into his arms. He could not resist me\u2014he burst into tears, and our tears mingled as we folded each other in a close embrace.",
            "\u201c\u2018Write, oh, write a letter to the Empress Josephine!\u2019 I cried, sobbing. Napoleon started, reflected, and said, \u2018You remind me of a third heart which loves me. Thank you, my friend;\u2019 and then and there he sat down and wrote that letter to Josephine, with which Constant was sent off next day.\u201d",

Because your own heart is good!\u201d cried the ecstatic old gentleman, and, strangely enough, real tears glistened in his eyes. \u201cYes, prince, it was a wonderful spectacle. And, do you know, I all but went off to Paris, and should assuredly have shared his solitary exile with him; but, alas, our destinies were otherwise ordered! We parted, he to his island, where I am sure he thought of the weeping child who had embraced him so affectionately at parting in Moscow; and I was sent off to the cadet corps, where I found nothing but roughness and harsh discipline. Alas, my happy days were done!\u201d",

On this occasion, when he recovered from his exaltation, he would probably suspect Muishkin of pitying him, and feel insulted.",
            "\u201cHave I been acting rightly in allowing him to develop such vast resources of imagination?\u201d the prince asked himself. But his answer was a fit of violent laughter which lasted ten whole minutes. He tried to reproach himself for the laughing fit, but eventually concluded that he needn\u2019t do so, since in spite of it he was truly sorry for the old man. The same evening he received a strange letter, short but decided. The general informed him that they must part for ever; that he was grateful, but that even from him he could not accept \u201csigns of sympathy which were humiliating to the dignity of a man already miserable enough.\u201d",

            "Hearing these words from her husband, Lizabetha Prokofievna was driven beside herself.",
            "According to her opinion, the whole thing had been one huge, fantastical, absurd, unpardonable mistake. \u201cFirst of all, this prince is an idiot, and, secondly, he is a fool\u2014knows nothing of the world, and has no place in it. Whom can he be shown to? Where can you take him to? What will old Bielokonski say? We never thought of such a husband as _that_ for our Aglaya!\u201d",
            "Of course, the last argument was the chief one. The maternal heart trembled with indignation to think of such an absurdity, although in that heart there rose another voice, which said: \u201cAnd _why_ is not the prince such a husband as you would have desired for Aglaya?\u201d It was this voice which annoyed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else.",
            "For some reason or other, the sisters liked the idea of the prince. They did not even consider it very strange; in a word, they might be expected at any moment to range themselves strongly on his side. But both of them decided to say nothing either way. It had always been noticed in the family that the stronger Mrs. Epanchin\u2019s opposition was to any project, the nearer she was, in reality, to giving in.",
            "Alexandra, however, found it difficult to keep absolute silence on the subject. Long since holding, as she did, the post of \u201cconfidential adviser to mamma,\u201d she was now perpetually called in council, and asked her opinion, and especially her assistance, in order to recollect \u201chow on earth all this happened?\u201d Why did no one see it? Why did no one say anything about it? What did all that wretched \u201cpoor knight\u201d joke mean? Why was she, Lizabetha Prokofievna, driven to think, and foresee, and worry for everybody, while they all sucked their thumbs, and counted the crows in the garden, and did nothing? At first, Alexandra had been very careful, and had merely replied that perhaps her father\u2019s remark was not so far out: that, in the eyes of the world, probably the choice of the prince as a husband for one of the Epanchin girls would be considered a very wise one. Warming up, however, she added that the prince was by no means a fool, and never had been; and that as to \u201cplace in the world,\u201d no one knew what the position of a respectable person in Russia would imply in a few years\u2014whether it would depend on successes in the government service, on the old system, or what.",
            "To all this her mother replied that Alexandra was a freethinker, and that all this was due to that \u201ccursed woman\u2019s rights question.\u201d",
            "Half an hour after this conversation, she went off to town, and thence to the Kammenny Ostrof, [\u201cStone Island,\u201d a suburb and park of St. Petersburg] to see Princess Bielokonski, who had just arrived from Moscow on a short visit. The princess was Aglaya\u2019s godmother.",
            "\u201cOld Bielokonski\u201d listened to all the fevered and despairing lamentations of Lizabetha Prokofievna without the least emotion; the tears of this sorrowful mother did not evoke answering sighs\u2014in fact, she laughed at her. She was a dreadful old despot, this princess; she could not allow equality in anything, not even in friendship of the oldest standing, and she insisted on treating Mrs. Epanchin as her _prot\u00e9g\u00e9e_, as she had been thirty-five years ago. She could never put up with the independence and energy of Lizabetha\u2019s character. She observed that, as usual, the whole family had gone much too far ahead, and had converted a fly into an elephant; that, so far as she had heard their story, she was persuaded that nothing of any seriousness had occurred; that it would surely be better to wait until something _did_ happen; that the prince, in her opinion, was a very decent young fellow, though perhaps a little eccentric, through illness, and not quite as weighty in the world as one could wish. The worst feature was, she said, Nastasia Philipovna.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna well understood that the old lady was angry at the failure of Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2014her own recommendation. She returned home to Pavlofsk in a worse humour than when she left, and of course everybody in the house suffered. She pitched into everyone, because, she declared, they had \u2018gone mad.\u2019 Why were things always mismanaged in her house? Why had everybody been in such a frantic hurry in this matter? So far as she could see, nothing whatever had happened. Surely they had better wait and see what was to happen, instead of making mountains out of molehills.",
            "And so the conclusion of the matter was that it would be far better to take it quietly, and wait coolly to see what would turn up. But, alas! peace did not reign for more than ten minutes. The first blow dealt to its power was in certain news communicated to Lizabetha Prokofievna as to events which had happened during her trip to see the princess. (This trip had taken place the day after that on which the prince had turned up at the Epanchins at nearly one o\u2019clock at night, thinking it was nine.)",
            "The sisters replied candidly and fully enough to their mother\u2019s impatient questions on her return. They said, in the first place, that nothing particular had happened since her departure; that the prince had been, and that Aglaya had kept him waiting a long while before she appeared\u2014half an hour, at least; that she had then come in, and immediately asked the prince to have a game of chess; that the prince did not know the game, and Aglaya had beaten him easily; that she had been in a wonderfully merry mood, and had laughed at the prince, and chaffed him so unmercifully that one was quite sorry to see his wretched expression.",
            "She had then asked him to play cards\u2014the game called \u201clittle fools.\u201d At this game the tables were turned completely, for the prince had shown himself a master at it. Aglaya had cheated and changed cards, and stolen others, in the most bare-faced way, but, in spite of everything the prince had beaten her hopelessly five times running, and she had been left \u201clittle fool\u201d each time.",
            "Aglaya then lost her temper, and began to say such awful things to the prince that he laughed no more, but grew dreadfully pale, especially when she said that she should not remain in the house with him, and that he ought to be ashamed of coming to their house at all, especially at night, \u201c_after all that had happened_.\u201d",
            "So saying, she had left the room, banging the door after her, and the prince went off, looking as though he were on his way to a funeral, in spite of all their attempts at consolation.",
            "Suddenly, a quarter of an hour after the prince\u2019s departure, Aglaya had rushed out of her room in such a hurry that she had not even wiped her eyes, which were full of tears. She came back because Colia had brought a hedgehog. Everybody came in to see the hedgehog. In answer to their questions Colia explained that the hedgehog was not his, and that he had left another boy, Kostia Lebedeff, waiting for him outside. Kostia was too shy to come in, because he was carrying a hatchet; they had bought the hedgehog and the hatchet from a peasant whom they had met on the road. He had offered to sell them the hedgehog, and they had paid fifty copecks for it; and the hatchet had so taken their fancy that they had made up their minds to buy it of their own accord. On hearing this, Aglaya urged Colia to sell her the hedgehog; she even called him \u201cdear Colia,\u201d in trying to coax him. He refused for a long time, but at last he could hold out no more, and went to fetch Kostia Lebedeff. The latter appeared, carrying his hatchet, and covered with confusion. Then it came out that the hedgehog was not theirs, but the property of a schoolmate, one Petroff, who had given them some money to buy Schlosser\u2019s History for him, from another schoolfellow who at that moment was driven to raising money by the sale of his books. Colia and Kostia were about to make this purchase for their friend when chance brought the hedgehog to their notice, and they had succumbed to the temptation of buying it. They were now taking Petroff the hedgehog and hatchet which they had bought with his money, instead of Schlosser\u2019s History. But Aglaya so entreated them that at last they consented to sell her the hedgehog. As soon as she had got possession of it, she put it in a wicker basket with Colia\u2019s help, and covered it with a napkin. Then she said to Colia: \u201cGo and take this hedgehog to the prince from me, and ask him to accept it as a token of my profound respect.\u201d Colia joyfully promised to do the errand, but he demanded explanations. \u201cWhat does the hedgehog mean? What is the meaning of such a present?\u201d Aglaya replied that it was none of his business. \u201cI am sure that there is some allegory about it,\u201d Colia persisted. Aglaya grew angry, and called him \u201ca silly boy.\u201d \u201cIf I did not respect all women in your person,\u201d replied Colia, \u201cand if my own principles would permit it, I would soon prove to you, that I know how to answer such an insult!\u201d But, in the end, Colia went off with the hedgehog in great delight, followed by Kostia Lebedeff. Aglaya\u2019s annoyance was soon over, and seeing that Colia was swinging the hedgehog\u2019s basket violently to and fro, she called out to him from the verandah, as if they had never quarrelled: \u201cColia, dear, please take care not to drop him!\u201d Colia appeared to have no grudge against her, either, for he stopped, and answered most cordially: \u201cNo, I will not drop him! Don\u2019t be afraid, Aglaya Ivanovna!\u201d After which he went on his way. Aglaya burst out laughing and ran up to her room, highly delighted. Her good spirits lasted the whole day.",
            "All this filled poor Lizabetha\u2019s mind with chaotic confusion. What on earth did it all mean? The most disturbing feature was the hedgehog. What was the symbolic signification of a hedgehog? What did they understand by it? What underlay it? Was it a cryptic message?",
            "Poor General Epanchin \u201cput his foot in it\u201d by answering the above questions in his own way. He said there was no cryptic message at all. As for the hedgehog, it was just a hedgehog, which meant nothing\u2014unless, indeed, it was a pledge of friendship,\u2014the sign of forgetting of offences and so on. At all events, it was a joke, and, of course, a most pardonable and innocent one.",
            "We may as well remark that the general had guessed perfectly accurately.",
            "The prince, returning home from the interview with Aglaya, had sat gloomy and depressed for half an hour. He was almost in despair when Colia arrived with the hedgehog.",
            "Then the sky cleared in a moment. The prince seemed to arise from the dead; he asked Colia all about it, made him repeat the story over and over again, and laughed and shook hands with the boys in his delight.",
            "It seemed clear to the prince that Aglaya forgave him, and that he might go there again this very evening; and in his eyes that was not only the main thing, but everything in the world.",
            "\u201cWhat children we are still, Colia!\u201d he cried at last, enthusiastically,\u2014\u201cand how delightful it is that we can be children still!\u201d",
            "\u201cSimply\u2014my dear prince,\u2014simply she is in love with you,\u2014that\u2019s the whole of the secret!\u201d replied Colia, with authority.",
            "The prince blushed, but this time he said nothing. Colia burst out laughing and clapped his hands. A minute later the prince laughed too, and from this moment until the evening he looked at his watch every other minute to see how much time he had to wait before evening came.",
            "But the situation was becoming rapidly critical.",
            "Mrs. Epanchin could bear her suspense no longer, and in spite of the opposition of husband and daughters, she sent for Aglaya, determined to get a straightforward answer out of her, once for all.",
            "\u201cOtherwise,\u201d she observed hysterically, \u201cI shall die before evening.\u201d",
            "It was only now that everyone realized to what a ridiculous dead-lock the whole matter had been brought. Excepting feigned surprise, indignation, laughter, and jeering\u2014both at the prince and at everyone who asked her questions,\u2014nothing could be got out of Aglaya.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna went to bed and only rose again in time for tea, when the prince might be expected.",
            "She awaited him in trembling agitation; and when he at last arrived she nearly went off into hysterics.",
            "Muishkin himself came in very timidly. He seemed to feel his way, and looked in each person\u2019s eyes in a questioning way,\u2014for Aglaya was absent, which fact alarmed him at once.",
            "This evening there were no strangers present\u2014no one but the immediate members of the family. Prince S. was still in town, occupied with the affairs of Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2019s uncle.",
            "\u201cI wish at least _he_ would come and say something!\u201d complained poor Lizabetha Prokofievna.",
            "The general sat still with a most preoccupied air. The sisters were looking very serious and did not speak a word, and Lizabetha Prokofievna did not know how to commence the conversation.",
            "At length she plunged into an energetic and hostile criticism of railways, and glared at the prince defiantly.",
            "Alas Aglaya still did not come\u2014and the prince was quite lost. He had the greatest difficulty in expressing his opinion that railways were most useful institutions,\u2014and in the middle of his speech Adelaida laughed, which threw him into a still worse state of confusion.",
            "At this moment in marched Aglaya, as calm and collected as could be. She gave the prince a ceremonious bow and solemnly took up a prominent position near the big round table. She looked at the prince questioningly.",
            "All present realized that the moment for the settlement of perplexities had arrived.",
            "\u201cDid you get my hedgehog?\u201d she inquired, firmly and almost angrily.",
            "\u201cYes, I got it,\u201d said the prince, blushing.",
            "\u201cTell us now, at once, what you made of the present? I must have you answer this question for mother\u2019s sake; she needs pacifying, and so do all the rest of the family!\u201d",
            "\u201cLook here, Aglaya\u2014\u201d began the general.",
            "\u201cThis\u2014this is going beyond all limits!\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, suddenly alarmed.",
            "\u201cIt is not in the least beyond all limits, mamma!\u201d said her daughter, firmly. \u201cI sent the prince a hedgehog this morning, and I wish to hear his opinion of it. Go on, prince.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat\u2014what sort of opinion, Aglaya Ivanovna?\u201d",
            "\u201cAbout the hedgehog.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is\u2014I suppose you wish to know how I received the hedgehog, Aglaya Ivanovna,\u2014or, I should say, how I regarded your sending him to me? In that case, I may tell you\u2014in a word\u2014that I\u2014in fact\u2014\u201d",
            "He paused, breathless.",
            "\u201cCome\u2014you haven\u2019t told us much!\u201d said Aglaya, after waiting some five seconds. \u201cVery well, I am ready to drop the hedgehog, if you like; but I am anxious to be able to clear up this accumulation of misunderstandings. Allow me to ask you, prince,\u2014I wish to hear from you, personally\u2014are you making me an offer, or not?\u201d",
            "\u201cGracious heavens!\u201d exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna. The prince started. The general stiffened in his chair; the sisters frowned.",
            "\u201cDon\u2019t deceive me now, prince\u2014tell the truth. All these people persecute me with astounding questions\u2014about you. Is there any ground for all these questions, or not? Come!\u201d",
            "\u201cI have not asked you to marry me yet, Aglaya Ivanovna,\u201d said the prince, becoming suddenly animated; \u201cbut you know yourself how much I love you and trust you.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo\u2014I asked you this\u2014answer this! Do you intend to ask for my hand, or not?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I do ask for it!\u201d said the prince, more dead than alive now.",
            "There was a general stir in the room.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014my dear girl,\u201d began the general. \u201cYou cannot proceed like this, Aglaya, if that\u2019s how the matter stands. It\u2019s impossible. Prince, forgive it, my dear fellow, but\u2014Lizabetha Prokofievna!\u201d\u2014he appealed to his spouse for help\u2014\u201cyou must really\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNot I\u2014not I! I retire from all responsibility,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a wave of the hand.",
            "\u201cAllow me to speak, please, mamma,\u201d said Aglaya. \u201cI think I ought to have something to say in the matter. An important moment of my destiny is about to be decided\u201d\u2014(this is how Aglaya expressed herself)\u2014\u201cand I wish to find out how the matter stands, for my own sake, though I am glad you are all here. Allow me to ask you, prince, since you cherish those intentions, how you consider that you will provide for my happiness?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t quite know how to answer your question, Aglaya Ivanovna. What is there to say to such a question? And\u2014and must I answer?\u201d",
            "\u201cI think you are rather overwhelmed and out of breath. Have a little rest, and try to recover yourself. Take a glass of water, or\u2014but they\u2019ll give you some tea directly.\u201d",
            "\u201cI love you, Aglaya Ivanovna,\u2014I love you very much. I love only you\u2014and\u2014please don\u2019t jest about it, for I do love you very much.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, this matter is important. We are not children\u2014we must look into it thoroughly. Now then, kindly tell me\u2014what does your fortune consist of?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo\u2014Aglaya\u2014come, enough of this, you mustn\u2019t behave like this,\u201d said her father, in dismay.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna in a loud whisper.",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s mad\u2014quite!\u201d said Alexandra.",
            "\u201cFortune\u2014money\u2014do you mean?\u201d asked the prince in some surprise.",
            "\u201cJust so.\u201d",
            "\u201cI have now\u2014let\u2019s see\u2014I have a hundred and thirty-five thousand roubles,\u201d said the prince, blushing violently.",
            "\u201cIs that all, really?\u201d said Aglaya, candidly, without the slightest show of confusion. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not so bad, especially if managed with economy. Do you intend to serve?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2014I intended to try for a certificate as private tutor.\u201d",
            "\u201cVery good. That would increase our income nicely. Have you any intention of being a Kammer-junker?\u201d",
            "\u201cA Kammer-junker? I had not thought of it, but\u2014\u201d",
            "But here the two sisters could restrain themselves no longer, and both of them burst into irrepressible laughter.",
            "Adelaida had long since detected in Aglaya\u2019s features the gathering signs of an approaching storm of laughter, which she restrained with amazing self-control.",
            "Aglaya looked menacingly at her laughing sisters, but could not contain herself any longer, and the next minute she too had burst into an irrepressible, and almost hysterical, fit of mirth. At length she jumped up, and ran out of the room.",
            "\u201cI knew it was all a joke!\u201d cried Adelaida. \u201cI felt it ever since\u2014since the hedgehog.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no! I cannot allow this,\u2014this is a little too much,\u201d cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, exploding with rage, and she rose from her seat and followed Aglaya out of the room as quickly as she could.",
            "The two sisters hurriedly went after her.",
            "The prince and the general were the only two persons left in the room.",

            "\u201cI only see that Aglaya Ivanovna is laughing at me,\u201d said the poor prince, sadly.",

            "Aglaya raised her happy, tearful face from her mother\u2019s breast, glanced at her father, and burst out laughing. She sprang at him and hugged him too, and kissed him over and over again. She then rushed back to her mother and hid her face in the maternal bosom, and there indulged in more tears. Her mother covered her with a corner of her shawl.",
            "\u201cOh, you cruel little girl! How will you treat us all next, I wonder?\u201d she said, but she spoke with a ring of joy in her voice, and as though she breathed at last without the oppression which she had felt so long.",
            "\u201cCruel?\u201d sobbed Aglaya. \u201cYes, I _am_ cruel, and worthless, and spoiled\u2014tell father so,\u2014oh, here he is\u2014I forgot Father, listen!\u201d She laughed through her tears.",
            "\u201cMy darling, my little idol,\u201d cried the general, kissing and fondling her hands (Aglaya did not draw them away); \u201cso you love this young man, do you?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no, no, can\u2019t _bear_ him, I can\u2019t _bear_ your young man!\u201d cried Aglaya, raising her head. \u201cAnd if you dare say that _once_ more, papa\u2014I\u2019m serious, you know, I\u2019m,\u2014do you hear me\u2014I\u2019m serious!\u201d",
            "She certainly did seem to be serious enough. She had flushed up all over and her eyes were blazing.",
            "The general felt troubled and remained silent, while Lizabetha Prokofievna telegraphed to him from behind Aglaya to ask no questions.",
            "\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, darling\u2014then, of course, you shall do exactly as you like. He is waiting alone downstairs. Hadn\u2019t I better hint to him gently that he can go?\u201d The general telegraphed to Lizabetha Prokofievna in his turn.",
            "\u201cNo, no, you needn\u2019t do anything of the sort; you mustn\u2019t hint gently at all. I\u2019ll go down myself directly. I wish to apologize to this young man, because I hurt his feelings.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, _seriously_,\u201d said the general, gravely.",
            "\u201cWell, you\u2019d better stay here, all of you, for a little, and I\u2019ll go down to him alone to begin with. I\u2019ll just go in and then you can follow me almost at once. That\u2019s the best way.\u201d",
            "She had almost reached the door when she turned round again.",
            "\u201cI shall laugh\u2014I know I shall; I shall die of laughing,\u201d she said, lugubriously.",
            "However, she turned and ran down to the prince as fast as her feet could carry her.",
            "\u201cWell, what does it all mean? What do you make of it?\u201d asked the general of his spouse, hurriedly.",
            "\u201cI hardly dare say,\u201d said Lizabetha, as hurriedly, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s as plain as anything can be.\u201d",
            "\u201cI think so too, as clear as day; she loves him.\u201d",
            "\u201cLoves him? She is head over ears in love, that\u2019s what she is,\u201d put in Alexandra.",
            "\u201cWell, God bless her, God bless her, if such is her destiny,\u201d said Lizabetha, crossing herself devoutly.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m destiny it is,\u201d said the general, \u201cand there\u2019s no getting out of destiny.\u201d",
            "With these words they all moved off towards the drawing-room, where another surprise awaited them. Aglaya had not only not laughed, as she had feared, but had gone to the prince rather timidly, and said to him:",
            "\u201cForgive a silly, horrid, spoilt girl\u201d\u2014(she took his hand here)\u2014\u201cand be quite assured that we all of us esteem you beyond all words. And if I dared to turn your beautiful, admirable simplicity to ridicule, forgive me as you would a little child its mischief. Forgive me all my absurdity of just now, which, of course, meant nothing, and could not have the slightest consequence.\u201d She spoke these words with great emphasis.",
            "Her father, mother, and sisters came into the room and were much struck with the last words, which they just caught as they entered\u2014\u201cabsurdity which of course meant nothing\u201d\u2014and still more so with the emphasis with which Aglaya had spoken.",
            "They exchanged glances questioningly, but the prince did not seem to have understood the meaning of Aglaya\u2019s words; he was in the highest heaven of delight.",
            "\u201cWhy do you speak so?\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhy do you ask my forgiveness?\u201d",
            "He wished to add that he was unworthy of being asked for forgiveness by her, but paused. Perhaps he did understand Aglaya\u2019s sentence about \u201cabsurdity which meant nothing,\u201d and like the strange fellow that he was, rejoiced in the words.",
            "Undoubtedly the fact that he might now come and see Aglaya as much as he pleased again was quite enough to make him perfectly happy; that he might come and speak to her, and see her, and sit by her, and walk with her\u2014who knows, but that all this was quite enough to satisfy him for the whole of his life, and that he would desire no more to the end of time?",
            "(Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that this might be the case, and she didn\u2019t like it; though very probably she could not have put the idea into words.)",
            "It would be difficult to describe the animation and high spirits which distinguished the prince for the rest of the evening.",
            "He was so happy that \u201cit made one feel happy to look at him,\u201d as Aglaya\u2019s sisters expressed it afterwards. He talked, and told stories just as he had done once before, and never since, namely on the very first morning of his acquaintance with the Epanchins, six months ago. Since his return to Petersburg from Moscow, he had been remarkably silent, and had told Prince S. on one occasion, before everyone, that he did not think himself justified in degrading any thought by his unworthy words.",
            "But this evening he did nearly all the talking himself, and told stories by the dozen, while he answered all questions put to him clearly, gladly, and with any amount of detail.",
            "There was nothing, however, of love-making in his talk. His ideas were all of the most serious kind; some were even mystical and profound.",
            "He aired his own views on various matters, some of his most private opinions and observations, many of which would have seemed rather funny, so his hearers agreed afterwards, had they not been so well expressed.",
            "The general liked serious subjects of conversation; but both he and Lizabetha Prokofievna felt that they were having a little too much of a good thing tonight, and as the evening advanced, they both grew more or less melancholy; but towards night, the prince fell to telling funny stories, and was always the first to burst out laughing himself, which he invariably did so joyously and simply that the rest laughed just as much at him as at his stories.",
            "As for Aglaya, she hardly said a word all the evening; but she listened with all her ears to Lef Nicolaievitch\u2019s talk, and scarcely took her eyes off him.",
            "\u201cShe looked at him, and stared and stared, and hung on every word he said,\u201d said Lizabetha afterwards, to her husband, \u201cand yet, tell her that she loves him, and she is furious!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done? It\u2019s fate,\u201d said the general, shrugging his shoulders, and, for a long while after, he continued to repeat: \u201cIt\u2019s fate, it\u2019s fate!\u201d",
            "We may add that to a business man like General Epanchin the present position of affairs was most unsatisfactory. He hated the uncertainty in which they had been, perforce, left. However, he decided to say no more about it, and merely to look on, and take his time and tune from Lizabetha Prokofievna.",
            "The happy state in which the family had spent the evening, as just recorded, was not of very long duration. Next day Aglaya quarrelled with the prince again, and so she continued to behave for the next few days. For whole hours at a time she ridiculed and chaffed the wretched man, and made him almost a laughing-stock.",
            "It is true that they used to sit in the little summer-house together for an hour or two at a time, very often, but it was observed that on these occasions the prince would read the paper, or some book, aloud to Aglaya.",
            "\u201cDo you know,\u201d Aglaya said to him once, interrupting the reading, \u201cI\u2019ve remarked that you are dreadfully badly educated. You never know anything thoroughly, if one asks you; neither anyone\u2019s name, nor dates, nor about treaties and so on. It\u2019s a great pity, you know!\u201d",
            "\u201cI told you I had not had much of an education,\u201d replied the prince.",
            "\u201cHow am I to respect you, if that\u2019s the case? Read on now. No\u2014don\u2019t! Stop reading!\u201d",
            "And once more, that same evening, Aglaya mystified them all. Prince S. had returned, and Aglaya was particularly amiable to him, and asked a great deal after Evgenie Pavlovitch. (Muishkin had not come in as yet.)",
            "Suddenly Prince S. hinted something about \u201ca new and approaching change in the family.\u201d He was led to this remark by a communication inadvertently made to him by Lizabetha Prokofievna, that Adelaida\u2019s marriage must be postponed a little longer, in order that the two weddings might come off together.",
            "It is impossible to describe Aglaya\u2019s irritation. She flared up, and said some indignant words about \u201call these silly insinuations.\u201d She added that \u201cshe had no intentions as yet of replacing anybody\u2019s mistress.\u201d",
            "These words painfully impressed the whole party; but especially her parents. Lizabetha Prokofievna summoned a secret council of two, and insisted upon the general\u2019s demanding from the prince a full explanation of his relations with Nastasia Philipovna. The general argued that it was only a whim of Aglaya\u2019s; and that, had not Prince S. unfortunately made that remark, which had confused the child and made her blush, she never would have said what she did; and that he was sure Aglaya knew well that anything she might have heard of the prince and Nastasia Philipovna was merely the fabrication of malicious tongues, and that the woman was going to marry Rogojin. He insisted that the prince had nothing whatever to do with Nastasia Philipovna, so far as any liaison was concerned; and, if the truth were to be told about it, he added, never had had.",
            "Meanwhile nothing put the prince out, and he continued to be in the seventh heaven of bliss. Of course he could not fail to observe some impatience and ill-temper in Aglaya now and then; but he believed in something else, and nothing could now shake his conviction. Besides, Aglaya\u2019s frowns never lasted long; they disappeared of themselves.",
            "Perhaps he was too easy in his mind. So thought Hippolyte, at all events, who met him in the park one day.",
            "\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the truth now, when I said you were in love?\u201d he said, coming up to Muishkin of his own accord, and stopping him.",
            "The prince gave him his hand and congratulated him upon \u201clooking so well.\u201d",
            "Hippolyte himself seemed to be hopeful about his state of health, as is often the case with consumptives.",
            "He had approached the prince with the intention of talking sarcastically about his happy expression of face, but very soon forgot his intention and began to talk about himself. He began complaining about everything, disconnectedly and endlessly, as was his wont.",
            "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d he concluded, \u201chow irritating they all are there. They are such wretchedly small, vain, egotistical, _commonplace_ people! Would you believe it, they invited me there under the express condition that I should die quickly, and they are all as wild as possible with me for not having died yet, and for being, on the contrary, a good deal better! Isn\u2019t it a comedy? I don\u2019t mind betting that you don\u2019t believe me!\u201d",
            "The prince said nothing.",
            "\u201cI sometimes think of coming over to you again,\u201d said Hippolyte, carelessly. \u201cSo you _don\u2019t_ think them capable of inviting a man on the condition that he is to look sharp and die?\u201d",
            "\u201cI certainly thought they invited you with quite other views.\u201d",
            "\u201cHo, ho! you are not nearly so simple as they try to make you out! This is not the time for it, or I would tell you a thing or two about that beauty, Gania, and his hopes. You are being undermined, pitilessly undermined, and\u2014and it is really melancholy to see you so calm about it. But alas! it\u2019s your nature\u2014you can\u2019t help it!\u201d",
            "\u201cMy word! what a thing to be melancholy about! Why, do you think I should be any happier if I were to feel disturbed about the excavations you tell me of?\u201d",
            "\u201cIt is better to be unhappy and know the worst, than to be happy in a fool\u2019s paradise! I suppose you don\u2019t believe that you have a rival in that quarter?\u201d",
            "\u201cYour insinuations as to rivalry are rather cynical, Hippolyte. I\u2019m sorry to say I have no right to answer you! As for Gania, I put it to you, _can_ any man have a happy mind after passing through what he has had to suffer? I think that is the best way to look at it. He will change yet, he has lots of time before him, and life is rich; besides\u2014besides...\u201d the prince hesitated. \u201cAs to being undermined, I don\u2019t know what in the world you are driving at, Hippolyte. I think we had better drop the subject!\u201d",
            "\u201cVery well, we\u2019ll drop it for a while. You can\u2019t look at anything but in your exalted, generous way. You must put out your finger and touch a thing before you\u2019ll believe it, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I suppose you despise me dreadfully, prince, eh? What do you think?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy? Because you have suffered more than we have?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo; because I am unworthy of my sufferings, if you like!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhoever _can_ suffer is worthy to suffer, I should think. Aglaya Ivanovna wished to see you, after she had read your confession, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cShe postponed the pleasure\u2014I see\u2014I quite understand!\u201d said Hippolyte, hurriedly, as though he wished to banish the subject. \u201cI hear\u2014they tell me\u2014that you read her all that nonsense aloud? Stupid bosh it was\u2014written in delirium. And I can\u2019t understand how anyone can be so\u2014I won\u2019t say _cruel_, because the word would be humiliating to myself, but we\u2019ll say childishly vain and revengeful, as to _reproach_ me with this confession, and use it as a weapon against me. Don\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m not referring to yourself.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I\u2019m sorry you repudiate the confession, Hippolyte\u2014it is sincere; and, do you know, even the absurd parts of it\u2014and these are many\u201d (here Hippolyte frowned savagely) \u201care, as it were, redeemed by suffering\u2014for it must have cost you something to admit what you there say\u2014great torture, perhaps, for all I know. Your motive must have been a very noble one all through. Whatever may have appeared to the contrary, I give you my word, I see this more plainly every day. I do not judge you; I merely say this to have it off my mind, and I am only sorry that I did not say it all _then_\u2014\u201d",
            "Hippolyte flushed hotly. He had thought at first that the prince was \u201chumbugging\u201d him; but on looking at his face he saw that he was absolutely serious, and had no thought of any deception. Hippolyte beamed with gratification.",
            "\u201cAnd yet I must die,\u201d he said, and almost added: \u201ca man like me!",
            "\u201cAnd imagine how that Gania annoys me! He has developed the idea\u2014or pretends to believe\u2014that in all probability three or four others who heard my confession will die before I do. There\u2019s an idea for you\u2014and all this by way of _consoling_ me! Ha! ha! ha! In the first place they haven\u2019t died yet; and in the second, if they _did_ die\u2014all of them\u2014what would be the satisfaction to me in that? He judges me by himself. But he goes further, he actually pitches into me because, as he declares, \u2018any decent fellow\u2019 would die quietly, and that \u2018all this\u2019 is mere egotism on my part. He doesn\u2019t see what refinement of egotism it is on his own part\u2014and at the same time, what ox-like coarseness! Have you ever read of the death of one Stepan Gleboff, in the eighteenth century? I read of it yesterday by chance.\u201d",

            "\u201cI know, I know! He lay there fifteen hours in the hard frost, and died with the most extraordinary fortitude\u2014I know\u2014what of him?\u201d",
            "\u201cOnly that God gives that sort of dying to some, and not to others. Perhaps you think, though, that I could not die like Gleboff?\u201d",
            "\u201cNot at all!\u201d said the prince, blushing. \u201cI was only going to say that you\u2014not that you could not be like Gleboff\u2014but that you would have been more like\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI guess what you mean\u2014I should be an Osterman, not a Gleboff\u2014eh? Is that what you meant?\u201d",

            "\u201cWhy, Osterman\u2014the diplomatist. Peter\u2019s Osterman,\u201d muttered Hippolyte, confused. There was a moment\u2019s pause of mutual confusion.",
            "\u201cOh, no, no!\u201d said the prince at last, \u201cthat was not what I was going to say\u2014oh no! I don\u2019t think you would ever have been like Osterman.\u201d",
            "Hippolyte frowned gloomily.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I draw the conclusion,\u201d explained the prince, evidently desirous of clearing up the matter a little. \u201cBecause, though I often think over the men of those times, I cannot for the life of me imagine them to be like ourselves. It really appears to me that they were of another race altogether than ourselves of today. At that time people seemed to stick so to one idea; now, they are more nervous, more sensitive, more enlightened\u2014people of two or three ideas at once\u2014as it were. The man of today is a broader man, so to speak\u2014and I declare I believe that is what prevents him from being so self-contained and independent a being as his brother of those earlier days. Of course my remark was only made under this impression, and not in the least\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI quite understand. You are trying to comfort me for the naiveness with which you disagreed with me\u2014eh? Ha! ha! ha! You are a regular child, prince! However, I cannot help seeing that you always treat me like\u2014like a fragile china cup. Never mind, never mind, I\u2019m not a bit angry! At all events we have had a very funny talk. Do you know, all things considered, I should like to be something better than Osterman! I wouldn\u2019t take the trouble to rise from the dead to be an Osterman. However, I see I must make arrangements to die soon, or I myself\u2014. Well\u2014leave me now! _Au revoir._ Look here\u2014before you go, just give me your opinion: how do you think I ought to die, now? I mean\u2014the best, the most virtuous way? Tell me!\u201d",
            "\u201cYou should pass us by and forgive us our happiness,\u201d said the prince in a low voice.",
            "\u201cHa! ha! ha! I thought so. I thought I should hear something like that. Well, you are\u2014you really are\u2014oh dear me! Eloquence, eloquence! Good-bye!\u201d "

Besides, Princess Bielokonski was going away soon, and they hoped that she would take an interest in the prince. They were anxious that he should enter society under the auspices of this lady, whose patronage was the best of recommendations for any young man.",
            "Even if there seems something strange about the match, the general and his wife said to each other, the \u201cworld\u201d will accept Aglaya\u2019s fiance without any question if he is under the patronage of the princess. In any case, the prince would have to be \u201cshown\u201d sooner or later; that is, introduced into society, of which he had, so far, not the least idea. Moreover, it was only a question of a small gathering of a few intimate friends. Besides Princess Bielokonski, only one other lady was expected, the wife of a high dignitary. Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was to escort the princess, was the only young man.",
            "Muishkin was told of the princess\u2019s visit three days beforehand, but nothing was said to him about the party until the night before it was to take place.",
            "He could not help observing the excited and agitated condition of all members of the family, and from certain hints dropped in conversation he gathered that they were all anxious as to the impression he should make upon the princess. But the Epanchins, one and all, believed that Muishkin, in his simplicity of mind, was quite incapable of realizing that they could be feeling any anxiety on his account, and for this reason they all looked at him with dread and uneasiness.",
            "In point of fact, he did attach marvellously little importance to the approaching event. He was occupied with altogether different thoughts. Aglaya was growing hourly more capricious and gloomy, and this distressed him. When they told him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was expected, he evinced great delight, and said that he had long wished to see him\u2014and somehow these words did not please anyone.",
            "Aglaya left the room in a fit of irritation, and it was not until late in the evening, past eleven, when the prince was taking his departure, that she said a word or two to him, privately, as she accompanied him as far as the front door.",
            "\u201cI should like you,\u201d she said, \u201cnot to come here tomorrow until evening, when the guests are all assembled. You know there are to be guests, don\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "She spoke impatiently and with severity; this was the first allusion she had made to the party of tomorrow.",
            "She hated the idea of it, everyone saw that; and she would probably have liked to quarrel about it with her parents, but pride and modesty prevented her from broaching the subject.",
            "The prince jumped to the conclusion that Aglaya, too, was nervous about him, and the impression he would make, and that she did not like to admit her anxiety; and this thought alarmed him.",
            "\u201cYes, I am invited,\u201d he replied.",
            "She was evidently in difficulties as to how best to go on. \u201cMay I speak of something serious to you, for once in my life?\u201d she asked, angrily. She was irritated at she knew not what, and could not restrain her wrath.",
            "\u201cOf course you may; I am very glad to listen,\u201d replied Muishkin.",

I always did feel a loathing for the laws which seem to guide mamma\u2019s conduct at times. I don\u2019t speak of father, for he cannot be expected to be anything but what he is. Mother is a noble-minded woman, I know; you try to suggest anything mean to her, and you\u2019ll see! But she is such a slave to these miserable creatures! I don\u2019t mean old Bielokonski alone. She is a contemptible old thing, but she is able to twist people round her little finger, and I admire that in her, at all events! How mean it all is, and how foolish! We were always middle-class, thoroughly middle-class, people. Why should we attempt to climb into the giddy heights of the fashionable world? My sisters are all for it. It\u2019s Prince S. they have to thank for poisoning their minds. Why are you so glad that Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming?\u201d",
            "\u201cListen to me, Aglaya,\u201d said the prince, \u201cI do believe you are nervous lest I shall make a fool of myself tomorrow at your party?\u201d",
            "\u201cNervous about you?\u201d Aglaya blushed. \u201cWhy should I be nervous about you? What would it matter to me if you were to make ever such a fool of yourself? How can you say such a thing? What do you mean by \u2018making a fool of yourself\u2019? What a vulgar expression! I suppose you intend to talk in that sort of way tomorrow evening? Look up a few more such expressions in your dictionary; do, you\u2019ll make a grand effect! I\u2019m sorry that you seem to be able to come into a room as gracefully as you do; where did you learn the art? Do you think you can drink a cup of tea decently, when you know everybody is looking at you, on purpose to see how you do it?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I think I can.\u201d",
            "\u201cCan you? I\u2019m sorry for it then, for I should have had a good laugh at you otherwise. Do break _something_ at least, in the drawing-room! Upset the Chinese vase, won\u2019t you? It\u2019s a valuable one; _do_ break it. Mamma values it, and she\u2019ll go out of her mind\u2014it was a present. She\u2019ll cry before everyone, you\u2019ll see! Wave your hand about, you know, as you always do, and just smash it. Sit down near it on purpose.\u201d",
            "\u201cOn the contrary, I shall sit as far from it as I can. Thanks for the hint.\u201d",
            "\u201cHa, ha! Then you are afraid you _will_ wave your arms about! I wouldn\u2019t mind betting that you\u2019ll talk about some lofty subject, something serious and learned. How delightful, how tactful that will be!\u201d",
            "\u201cI should think it would be very foolish indeed, unless it happened to come in appropriately.\u201d",
            "\u201cLook here, once for all,\u201d cried Aglaya, boiling over, \u201cif I hear you talking about capital punishment, or the economical condition of Russia, or about Beauty redeeming the world, or anything of that sort, I\u2019ll\u2014well, of course I shall laugh and seem very pleased, but I warn you beforehand, don\u2019t look me in the face again! I\u2019m serious now, mind, this time I _am really_ serious.\u201d She certainly did say this very seriously, so much so, that she looked quite different from what she usually was, and the prince could not help noticing the fact. She did not seem to be joking in the slightest degree.",
            "\u201cWell, you\u2019ve put me into such a fright that I shall certainly make a fool of myself, and very likely break something too. I wasn\u2019t a bit alarmed before, but now I\u2019m as nervous as can be.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen don\u2019t speak at all. Sit still and don\u2019t talk.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I can\u2019t do that, you know! I shall say something foolish out of pure \u2018funk,\u2019 and break something for the same excellent reason; I know I shall. Perhaps I shall slip and fall on the slippery floor; I\u2019ve done that before now, you know. I shall dream of it all night now. Why did you say anything about it?\u201d",
            "Aglaya looked blackly at him.",
            "\u201cDo you know what, I had better not come at all tomorrow! I\u2019ll plead sick-list and stay away,\u201d said the prince, with decision.",
            "Aglaya stamped her foot, and grew quite pale with anger.",
            "\u201cOh, my goodness! Just listen to that! \u2018Better not come,\u2019 when the party is on purpose for him! Good Lord! What a delightful thing it is to have to do with such a\u2014such a stupid as you are!\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I\u2019ll come, I\u2019ll come,\u201d interrupted the prince, hastily, \u201cand I\u2019ll give you my word of honour that I will sit the whole evening and not say a word.\u201d",
            "\u201cI believe that\u2019s the best thing you can do. You said you\u2019d \u2018plead sick-list\u2019 just now; where in the world do you get hold of such expressions? Why do you talk to me like this? Are you trying to irritate me, or what?\u201d",
            "\u201cForgive me, it\u2019s a schoolboy expression. I won\u2019t do it again. I know quite well, I see it, that you are anxious on my account (now, don\u2019t be angry), and it makes me very happy to see it. You wouldn\u2019t believe how frightened I am of misbehaving somehow, and how glad I am of your instructions. But all this panic is simply nonsense, you know, Aglaya! I give you my word it is; I am so pleased that you are such a child, such a dear good child. How _charming_ you can be if you like, Aglaya.\u201d",
            "Aglaya wanted to be angry, of course, but suddenly some quite unexpected feeling seized upon her heart, all in a moment.",
            "\u201cAnd you won\u2019t reproach me for all these rude words of mine\u2014some day\u2014afterwards?\u201d she asked, of a sudden.",
            "\u201cWhat an idea! Of course not. And what are you blushing for again? And there comes that frown once more! You\u2019ve taken to looking too gloomy sometimes, Aglaya, much more than you used to. I know why it is.\u201d",
            "\u201cBe quiet, do be quiet!\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, no, I had much better speak out. I have long wished to say it, and _have_ said it, but that\u2019s not enough, for you didn\u2019t believe me. Between us two there stands a being who\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cBe quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet!\u201d Aglaya struck in, suddenly, seizing his hand in hers, and gazing at him almost in terror.",
            "At this moment she was called by someone. She broke loose from him with an air of relief and ran away.",
            "The prince was in a fever all night. It was strange, but he had suffered from fever for several nights in succession. On this particular night, while in semi-delirium, he had an idea: what if on the morrow he were to have a fit before everybody? The thought seemed to freeze his blood within him. All night he fancied himself in some extraordinary society of strange persons. The worst of it was that he was talking nonsense; he knew that he ought not to speak at all, and yet he talked the whole time; he seemed to be trying to persuade them all to something. Evgenie and Hippolyte were among the guests, and appeared to be great friends.",
            "He awoke towards nine o\u2019clock with a headache, full of confused ideas and strange impressions. For some reason or other he felt most anxious to see Rogojin, to see and talk to him, but what he wished to say he could not tell. Next, he determined to go and see Hippolyte. His mind was in a confused state, so much so that the incidents of the morning seemed to be imperfectly realized, though acutely felt.",
            "One of these incidents was a visit from Lebedeff. Lebedeff came rather early\u2014before ten\u2014but he was tipsy already. Though the prince was not in an observant condition, yet he could not avoid seeing that for at least three days\u2014ever since General Ivolgin had left the house Lebedeff had been behaving very badly. He looked untidy and dirty at all times of the day, and it was said that he had begun to rage about in his own house, and that his temper was very bad. As soon as he arrived this morning, he began to hold forth, beating his breast and apparently blaming himself for something.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve had a reward for my meanness\u2014I\u2019ve had a slap in the face,\u201d he concluded, tragically.",
            "\u201cA slap in the face? From whom? And so early in the morning?\u201d",
            "\u201cEarly?\u201d said Lebedeff, sarcastically. \u201cTime counts for nothing, even in physical chastisement; but my slap in the face was not physical, it was moral.\u201d",
            "He suddenly took a seat, very unceremoniously, and began his story. It was very disconnected; the prince frowned, and wished he could get away; but suddenly a few words struck him. He sat stiff with wonder\u2014Lebedeff said some extraordinary things.",
            "In the first place he began about some letter; the name of Aglaya Ivanovna came in. Then suddenly he broke off and began to accuse the prince of something; he was apparently offended with him. At first he declared that the prince had trusted him with his confidences as to \u201ca certain person\u201d (Nastasia Philipovna), but that of late his friendship had been thrust back into his bosom, and his innocent question as to \u201capproaching family changes\u201d had been curtly put aside, which Lebedeff declared, with tipsy tears, he could not bear; especially as he knew so much already both from Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna and her friend, and from Varvara Ardalionovna, and even from Aglaya Ivanovna, through his daughter Vera. \u201cAnd who told Lizabetha Prokofievna something in secret, by letter? Who told her all about the movements of a certain person called Nastasia Philipovna? Who was the anonymous person, eh? Tell me!\u201d",
            "\u201cSurely not you?\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cJust so,\u201d said Lebedeff, with dignity; \u201cand only this very morning I have sent up a letter to the noble lady, stating that I have a matter of great importance to communicate. She received the letter; I know she got it; and she received _me_, too.\u201d",
            "\u201cHave you just seen Lizabetha Prokofievna?\u201d asked the prince, scarcely believing his ears.",
            "\u201cYes, I saw her, and got the said slap in the face as mentioned. She chucked the letter back to me unopened, and kicked me out of the house, morally, not physically, although not far off it.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat letter do you mean she returned unopened?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat! didn\u2019t I tell you? Ha, ha, ha! I thought I had. Why, I received a letter, you know, to be handed over\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cFrom whom? To whom?\u201d",
            "But it was difficult, if not impossible, to extract anything from Lebedeff. All the prince could gather was, that the letter had been received very early, and had a request written on the outside that it might be sent on to the address given.",
            "\u201cJust as before, sir, just as before! To a certain person, and from a certain hand. The individual\u2019s name who wrote the letter is to be represented by the letter A.\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat? Impossible! To Nastasia Philipovna? Nonsense!\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cIt was, I assure you, and if not to her then to Rogojin, which is the same thing. Mr. Hippolyte has had letters, too, and all from the individual whose name begins with an A.,\u201d smirked Lebedeff, with a hideous grin.",
            "As he kept jumping from subject to subject, and forgetting what he had begun to talk about, the prince said nothing, but waited, to give him time.",
            "It was all very vague. Who had taken the letters, if letters there were? Probably Vera\u2014and how could Lebedeff have got them? In all probability, he had managed to steal the present letter from Vera, and had himself gone over to Lizabetha Prokofievna with some idea in his head. So the prince concluded at last.",
            "\u201cYou are mad!\u201d he cried, indignantly.",
            "\u201cNot quite, esteemed prince,\u201d replied Lebedeff, with some acerbity. \u201cI confess I thought of doing you the service of handing the letter over to yourself, but I decided that it would pay me better to deliver it up to the noble lady aforesaid, as I had informed her of everything hitherto by anonymous letters; so when I sent her up a note from myself, with the letter, you know, in order to fix a meeting for eight o\u2019clock this morning, I signed it \u2018your secret correspondent.\u2019 They let me in at once\u2014very quickly\u2014by the back door, and the noble lady received me.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell? Go on.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, well, when I saw her she almost punched my head, as I say; in fact so nearly that one might almost say she did punch my head. She threw the letter in my face; she seemed to reflect first, as if she would have liked to keep it, but thought better of it and threw it in my face instead. \u2018If anybody can have been such a fool as to trust a man like you to deliver the letter,\u2019 says she, \u2018take it and deliver it!\u2019 Hey! she was grandly indignant. A fierce, fiery lady that, sir!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere\u2019s the letter now?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, I\u2019ve still got it, here!\u201d",
            "And he handed the prince the very letter from Aglaya to Gania, which the latter showed with so much triumph to his sister at a later hour.",
            "\u201cThis letter cannot be allowed to remain in your hands.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s for you\u2014for you! I\u2019ve brought it you on purpose!\u201d cried Lebedeff, excitedly. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m yours again now, heart and hand, your slave; there was but a momentary pause in the flow of my love and esteem for you. Mea culpa, mea culpa! as the Pope of Rome says.\u201d",
            "\u201cThis letter should be sent on at once,\u201d said the prince, disturbed. \u201cI\u2019ll hand it over myself.\u201d",
            "\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better, esteemed prince, wouldn\u2019t it be better\u2014to\u2014don\u2019t you know\u2014\u201d",
            "Lebedeff made a strange and very expressive grimace; he twisted about in his chair, and did something, apparently symbolical, with his hands.",
            "\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said the prince.",
            "\u201cWhy, open it, for the time being, don\u2019t you know?\u201d he said, most confidentially and mysteriously.",
            "The prince jumped up so furiously that Lebedeff ran towards the door; having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked back to see if he might hope for pardon.",
            "\u201cOh, Lebedeff, Lebedeff! Can a man really sink to such depths of meanness?\u201d said the prince, sadly.",
            "Lebedeff\u2019s face brightened.",
            "\u201cOh, I\u2019m a mean wretch\u2014a mean wretch!\u201d he said, approaching the prince once more, and beating his breast, with tears in his eyes.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s abominable dishonesty, you know!\u201d",
            "\u201cDishonesty\u2014it is, it is! That\u2019s the very word!\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat in the world induces you to act so? You are nothing but a spy. Why did you write anonymously to worry so noble and generous a lady? Why should not Aglaya Ivanovna write a note to whomever she pleases? What did you mean to complain of today? What did you expect to get by it? What made you go at all?\u201d",
            "\u201cPure amiable curiosity,\u2014I assure you\u2014desire to do a service. That\u2019s all. Now I\u2019m entirely yours again, your slave; hang me if you like!\u201d",
            "\u201cDid you go before Lizabetha Prokofievna in your present condition?\u201d inquired the prince.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014oh no, fresher\u2014more the correct card. I only became this like after the humiliation I suffered there.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell\u2014that\u2019ll do; now leave me.\u201d",
            "This injunction had to be repeated several times before the man could be persuaded to move. Even then he turned back at the door, came as far as the middle of the room, and there went through his mysterious motions designed to convey the suggestion that the prince should open the letter. He did not dare put his suggestion into words again.",
            "After this performance, he smiled sweetly and left the room on tiptoe.",
            "All this had been very painful to listen to. One fact stood out certain and clear, and that was that poor Aglaya must be in a state of great distress and indecision and mental torment (\u201cfrom jealousy,\u201d the prince whispered to himself). Undoubtedly in this inexperienced, but hot and proud little head, there were all sorts of plans forming, wild and impossible plans, maybe; and the idea of this so frightened the prince that he could not make up his mind what to do. Something must be done, that was clear.",
            "He looked at the address on the letter once more. Oh, he was not in the least degree alarmed about Aglaya writing such a letter; he could trust her. What he did not like about it was that he could not trust Gania.",
            "However, he made up his mind that he would himself take the note and deliver it. Indeed, he went so far as to leave the house and walk up the road, but changed his mind when he had nearly reached Ptitsin\u2019s door. However, he there luckily met Colia, and commissioned him to deliver the letter to his brother as if direct from Aglaya. Colia asked no questions but simply delivered it, and Gania consequently had no suspicion that it had passed through so many hands.",
            "Arrived home again, the prince sent for Vera Lebedeff and told her as much as was necessary, in order to relieve her mind, for she had been in a dreadful state of anxiety since she had missed the letter. She heard with horror that her father had taken it. Muishkin learned from her that she had on several occasions performed secret missions both for Aglaya and for Rogojin, without, however, having had the slightest idea that in so doing she might injure the prince in any way.",
            "The latter, with one thing and another, was now so disturbed and confused, that when, a couple of hours or so later, a message came from Colia that the general was ill, he could hardly take the news in.",
            "However, when he did master the fact, it acted upon him as a tonic by completely distracting his attention. He went at once to Nina Alexandrovna\u2019s, whither the general had been carried, and stayed there until the evening. He could do no good, but there are people whom to have near one is a blessing at such times. Colia was in an almost hysterical state; he cried continuously, but was running about all day, all the same; fetching doctors, of whom he collected three; going to the chemist\u2019s, and so on.",
            "The general was brought round to some extent, but the doctors declared that he could not be said to be out of danger. Varia and Nina Alexandrovna never left the sick man\u2019s bedside; Gania was excited and distressed, but would not go upstairs, and seemed afraid to look at the patient. He wrung his hands when the prince spoke to him, and said that \u201csuch a misfortune at such a moment\u201d was terrible.",
            "The prince thought he knew what Gania meant by \u201csuch a moment.\u201d",
            "Hippolyte was not in the house. Lebedeff turned up late in the afternoon; he had been asleep ever since his interview with the prince in the morning. He was quite sober now, and cried with real sincerity over the sick general\u2014mourning for him as though he were his own brother. He blamed himself aloud, but did not explain why. He repeated over and over again to Nina Alexandrovna that he alone was to blame\u2014no one else\u2014but that he had acted out of \u201cpure amiable curiosity,\u201d and that \u201cthe deceased,\u201d as he insisted upon calling the still living general, had been the greatest of geniuses.",
            "He laid much stress on the genius of the sufferer, as if this idea must be one of immense solace in the present crisis.",
            "Nina Alexandrovna\u2014seeing his sincerity of feeling\u2014said at last, and without the faintest suspicion of reproach in her voice: \u201cCome, come\u2014don\u2019t cry! God will forgive you!\u201d",
            "Lebedeff was so impressed by these words, and the tone in which they were spoken, that he could not leave Nina Alexandrovna all the evening\u2014in fact, for several days. Till the general\u2019s death, indeed, he spent almost all his time at his side.",
            "Twice during the day a messenger came to Nina Alexandrovna from the Epanchins to inquire after the invalid.",
            "When\u2014late in the evening\u2014the prince made his appearance in Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2019s drawing-room, he found it full of guests. Mrs. Epanchin questioned him very fully about the general as soon as he appeared; and when old Princess Bielokonski wished to know \u201cwho this general was, and who was Nina Alexandrovna,\u201d she proceeded to explain in a manner which pleased the prince very much.",
            "He himself, when relating the circumstances of the general\u2019s illness to Lizabetha Prokofievna, \u201cspoke beautifully,\u201d as Aglaya\u2019s sisters declared afterwards\u2014\u201cmodestly, quietly, without gestures or too many words, and with great dignity.\u201d He had entered the room with propriety and grace, and he was perfectly dressed; he not only did not \u201cfall down on the slippery floor,\u201d as he had expressed it, but evidently made a very favourable impression upon the assembled guests.",
            "As for his own impression on entering the room and taking his seat, he instantly remarked that the company was not in the least such as Aglaya\u2019s words had led him to fear, and as he had dreamed of\u2014in nightmare form\u2014all night.",
            "This was the first time in his life that he had seen a little corner of what was generally known by the terrible name of \u201csociety.\u201d He had long thirsted, for reasons of his own, to penetrate the mysteries of the magic circle, and, therefore, this assemblage was of the greatest possible interest to him.",
            "His first impression was one of fascination. Somehow or other he felt that all these people must have been born on purpose to be together! It seemed to him that the Epanchins were not having a party at all; that these people must have been here always, and that he himself was one of them\u2014returned among them after a long absence, but one of them, naturally and indisputably.",
            "It never struck him that all this refined simplicity and nobility and wit and personal dignity might possibly be no more than an exquisite artistic polish. The majority of the guests\u2014who were somewhat empty-headed, after all, in spite of their aristocratic bearing\u2014never guessed, in their self-satisfied composure, that much of their superiority was mere veneer, which indeed they had adopted unconsciously and by inheritance.",
            "The prince would never so much as suspect such a thing in the delight of his first impression.",
            "He saw, for instance, that one important dignitary, old enough to be his grandfather, broke off his own conversation in order to listen to _him_\u2014a young and inexperienced man; and not only listened, but seemed to attach value to his opinion, and was kind and amiable, and yet they were strangers and had never seen each other before. Perhaps what most appealed to the prince\u2019s impressionability was the refinement of the old man\u2019s courtesy towards him. Perhaps the soil of his susceptible nature was really predisposed to receive a pleasant impression.",
            "Meanwhile all these people\u2014though friends of the family and of each other to a certain extent\u2014were very far from being such intimate friends of the family and of each other as the prince concluded. There were some present who never would think of considering the Epanchins their equals. There were even some who hated one another cordially. For instance, old Princess Bielokonski had all her life despised the wife of the \u201cdignitary,\u201d while the latter was very far from loving Lizabetha Prokofievna. The dignitary himself had been General Epanchin\u2019s protector from his youth up; and the general considered him so majestic a personage that he would have felt a hearty contempt for himself if he had even for one moment allowed himself to pose as the great man\u2019s equal, or to think of him\u2014in his fear and reverence\u2014as anything less than an Olympic God! There were others present who had not met for years, and who had no feeling whatever for each other, unless it were dislike; and yet they met tonight as though they had seen each other but yesterday in some friendly and intimate assembly of kindred spirits.",
            "It was not a large party, however. Besides Princess Bielokonski and the old dignitary (who was really a great man) and his wife, there was an old military general\u2014a count or baron with a German name, a man reputed to possess great knowledge and administrative ability. He was one of those Olympian administrators who know everything except Russia, pronounce a word of extraordinary wisdom, admired by all, about once in five years, and, after being an eternity in the service, generally die full of honour and riches, though they have never done anything great, and have even been hostile to all greatness. This general was Ivan Fedorovitch\u2019s immediate superior in the service; and it pleased the latter to look upon him also as a patron. On the other hand, the great man did not at all consider himself Epanchin\u2019s patron. He was always very cool to him, while taking advantage of his ready services, and would instantly have put another in his place if there had been the slightest reason for the change.",
            "Another guest was an elderly, important-looking gentleman, a distant relative of Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2019s. This gentleman was rich, held a good position, was a great talker, and had the reputation of being \u201cone of the dissatisfied,\u201d though not belonging to the dangerous sections of that class. He had the manners, to some extent, of the English aristocracy, and some of their tastes (especially in the matter of under-done roast beef, harness, men-servants, etc.). He was a great friend of the dignitary\u2019s, and Lizabetha Prokofievna, for some reason or other, had got hold of the idea that this worthy intended at no distant date to offer the advantages of his hand and heart to Alexandra.",
            "Besides the elevated and more solid individuals enumerated, there were present a few younger though not less elegant guests. Besides Prince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch, we must name the eminent and fascinating Prince N.\u2014once the vanquisher of female hearts all over Europe. This gentleman was no longer in the first bloom of youth\u2014he was forty-five, but still very handsome. He was well off, and lived, as a rule, abroad, and was noted as a good teller of stories. Then came a few guests belonging to a lower stratum of society\u2014people who, like the Epanchins themselves, moved only occasionally in this exalted sphere. The Epanchins liked to draft among their more elevated guests a few picked representatives of this lower stratum, and Lizabetha Prokofievna received much praise for this practice, which proved, her friends said, that she was a woman of tact. The Epanchins prided themselves upon the good opinion people held of them.",
            "One of the representatives of the middle-class present today was a colonel of engineers, a very serious man and a great friend of Prince S., who had introduced him to the Epanchins. He was extremely silent in society, and displayed on the forefinger of his right hand a large ring, probably bestowed upon him for services of some sort. There was also a poet, German by name, but a Russian poet; very presentable, and even handsome\u2014the sort of man one could bring into society with impunity. This gentleman belonged to a German family of decidedly bourgeois origin, but he had a knack of acquiring the patronage of \u201cbig-wigs,\u201d and of retaining their favour. He had translated some great German poem into Russian verse, and claimed to have been a friend of a famous Russian poet, since dead. (It is strange how great a multitude of literary people there are who have had the advantages of friendship with some great man of their own profession who is, unfortunately, dead.) The dignitary\u2019s wife had introduced this worthy to the Epanchins. This lady posed as the patroness of literary people, and she certainly had succeeded in obtaining pensions for a few of them, thanks to her influence with those in authority on such matters. She was a lady of weight in her own way. Her age was about forty-five, so that she was a very young wife for such an elderly husband as the dignitary. She had been a beauty in her day and still loved, as many ladies of forty-five do love, to dress a little too smartly. Her intellect was nothing to boast of, and her literary knowledge very doubtful. Literary patronage was, however, with her as much a mania as was the love of gorgeous clothes. Many books and translations were dedicated to her by her proteges, and a few of these talented individuals had published some of their own letters to her, upon very weighty subjects.",
            "This, then, was the society that the prince accepted at once as true coin, as pure gold without alloy.",
            "It so happened, however, that on this particular evening all these good people were in excellent humour and highly pleased with themselves. Every one of them felt that they were doing the Epanchins the greatest possible honour by their presence. But alas! the prince never suspected any such subtleties! For instance, he had no suspicion of the fact that the Epanchins, having in their mind so important a step as the marriage of their daughter, would never think of presuming to take it without having previously \u201cshown off\u201d the proposed husband to the dignitary\u2014the recognized patron of the family. The latter, too, though he would probably have received news of a great disaster to the Epanchin family with perfect composure, would nevertheless have considered it a personal offence if they had dared to marry their daughter without his advice, or we might almost say, his leave.",
            "The amiable and undoubtedly witty Prince N. could not but feel that he was as a sun, risen for one night only to shine upon the Epanchin drawing-room. He accounted them immeasurably his inferiors, and it was this feeling which caused his special amiability and delightful ease and grace towards them. He knew very well that he must tell some story this evening for the edification of the company, and led up to it with the inspiration of anticipatory triumph.",
            "The prince, when he heard the story afterwards, felt that he had never yet come across so wonderful a humorist, or such remarkable brilliancy as was shown by this man; and yet if he had only known it, this story was the oldest, stalest, and most worn-out yarn, and every drawing-room in town was sick to death of it. It was only in the innocent Epanchin household that it passed for a new and brilliant tale\u2014as a sudden and striking reminiscence of a splendid and talented man.",
            "Even the German poet, though as amiable as possible, felt that he was doing the house the greatest of honours by his presence in it.",
            "But the prince only looked at the bright side; he did not turn the coat and see the shabby lining.",
            "Aglaya had not foreseen that particular calamity. She herself looked wonderfully beautiful this evening. All three sisters were dressed very tastefully, and their hair was done with special care.",
            "Aglaya sat next to Evgenie Pavlovitch, and laughed and talked to him with an unusual display of friendliness. Evgenie himself behaved rather more sedately than usual, probably out of respect to the dignitary. Evgenie had been known in society for a long while. He had appeared at the Epanchins\u2019 today with crape on his hat, and Princess Bielokonski had commended this action on his part. Not every society man would have worn crape for \u201csuch an uncle.\u201d Lizabetha Prokofievna had liked it also, but was too preoccupied to take much notice. The prince remarked that Aglaya looked attentively at him two or three times, and seemed to be satisfied with his behaviour.",
            "Little by little he became very happy indeed. All his late anxieties and apprehensions (after his conversation with Lebedeff) now appeared like so many bad dreams\u2014impossible, and even laughable.",
            "He did not speak much, only answering such questions as were put to him, and gradually settled down into unbroken silence, listening to what went on, and steeped in perfect satisfaction and contentment.",
            "Little by little a sort of inspiration, however, began to stir within him, ready to spring into life at the right moment. When he did begin to speak, it was accidentally, in response to a question, and apparently without any special object. "

        "VII.": [
            "The conversation had been on the subject of land, and the present disorders, and there must have been something amusing said, for the old man had begun to laugh at his companion\u2019s heated expressions.",
            "The latter was describing in eloquent words how, in consequence of recent legislation, he was obliged to sell a beautiful estate in the N. province, not because he wanted ready money\u2014in fact, he was obliged to sell it at half its value. \u201cTo avoid another lawsuit about the Pavlicheff estate, I ran away,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a few more inheritances of that kind I should soon be ruined!\u201d",
            "At this point General Epanchin, noticing how interested Muishkin had become in the conversation, said to him, in a low tone:",
            "\u201cThat gentleman\u2014Ivan Petrovitch\u2014is a relation of your late friend, Mr. Pavlicheff. You wanted to find some of his relations, did you not?\u201d",
            "The general, who had been talking to his chief up to this moment, had observed the prince\u2019s solitude and silence, and was anxious to draw him into the conversation, and so introduce him again to the notice of some of the important personages.",
            "\u201cLef Nicolaievitch was a ward of Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, after the death of his own parents,\u201d he remarked, meeting Ivan Petrovitch\u2019s eye.",
            "\u201cVery happy to meet him, I\u2019m sure,\u201d remarked the latter. \u201cI remember Lef Nicolaievitch well. When General Epanchin introduced us just now, I recognized you at once, prince. You are very little changed, though I saw you last as a child of some ten or eleven years old. There was something in your features, I suppose, that\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYou saw me as a child!\u201d exclaimed the prince, with surprise.",
            "\u201cOh! yes, long ago,\u201d continued Ivan Petrovitch, \u201cwhile you were living with my cousin at Zlatoverhoff. You don\u2019t remember me? No, I dare say you don\u2019t; you had some malady at the time, I remember. It was so serious that I was surprised\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cNo; I remember nothing!\u201d said the prince. A few more words of explanation followed, words which were spoken without the smallest excitement by his companion, but which evoked the greatest agitation in the prince; and it was discovered that two old ladies to whose care the prince had been left by Pavlicheff, and who lived at Zlatoverhoff, were also relations of Ivan Petrovitch.",
            "The latter had no idea and could give no information as to why Pavlicheff had taken so great an interest in the little prince, his ward.",
            "\u201cIn point of fact I don\u2019t think I thought much about it,\u201d said the old fellow. He seemed to have a wonderfully good memory, however, for he told the prince all about the two old ladies, Pavlicheff\u2019s cousins, who had taken care of him, and whom, he declared, he had taken to task for being too severe with the prince as a small sickly boy\u2014the elder sister, at least; the younger had been kind, he recollected. They both now lived in another province, on a small estate left to them by Pavlicheff. The prince listened to all this with eyes sparkling with emotion and delight.",
            "He declared with unusual warmth that he would never forgive himself for having travelled about in the central provinces during these last six months without having hunted up his two old friends.",
            "He declared, further, that he had intended to go every day, but had always been prevented by circumstances; but that now he would promise himself the pleasure\u2014however far it was, he would find them out. And so Ivan Petrovitch _really_ knew Natalia Nikitishna!\u2014what a saintly nature was hers!\u2014and Martha Nikitishna! Ivan Petrovitch must excuse him, but really he was not quite fair on dear old Martha. She was severe, perhaps; but then what else could she be with such a little idiot as he was then? (Ha, ha.) He really was an idiot then, Ivan Petrovitch must know, though he might not believe it. (Ha, ha.) So he had really seen him there! Good heavens! And was he really and truly and actually a cousin of Pavlicheff\u2019s?",
            "\u201cI assure you of it,\u201d laughed Ivan Petrovitch, gazing amusedly at the prince.",
            "\u201cOh! I didn\u2019t say it because I _doubt_ the fact, you know. (Ha, ha.) How could I doubt such a thing? (Ha, ha, ha.) I made the remark because\u2014because Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff was such a splendid man, don\u2019t you see! Such a high-souled man, he really was, I assure you.\u201d",
            "The prince did not exactly pant for breath, but he \u201cseemed almost to _choke_ out of pure simplicity and goodness of heart,\u201d as Adelaida expressed it, on talking the party over with her fiance, the Prince S., next morning.",
            "\u201cBut, my goodness me,\u201d laughed Ivan Petrovitch, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I be cousin to even a splendid man?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, dear!\u201d cried the prince, confused, trying to hurry his words out, and growing more and more eager every moment: \u201cI\u2019ve gone and said another stupid thing. I don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2014I didn\u2019t mean that, you know\u2014I\u2014I\u2014he really was such a splendid man, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d",
            "The prince trembled all over. Why was he so agitated? Why had he flown into such transports of delight without any apparent reason? He had far outshot the measure of joy and emotion consistent with the occasion. Why this was it would be difficult to say.",
            "He seemed to feel warmly and deeply grateful to someone for something or other\u2014perhaps to Ivan Petrovitch; but likely enough to all the guests, individually, and collectively. He was much too happy.",
            "Ivan Petrovitch began to stare at him with some surprise; the dignitary, too, looked at him with considerable attention; Princess Bielokonski glared at him angrily, and compressed her lips. Prince N., Evgenie, Prince S., and the girls, all broke off their own conversations and listened. Aglaya seemed a little startled; as for Lizabetha Prokofievna, her heart sank within her.",
            "This was odd of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters. They had themselves decided that it would be better if the prince did not talk all the evening. Yet seeing him sitting silent and alone, but perfectly happy, they had been on the point of exerting themselves to draw him into one of the groups of talkers around the room. Now that he was in the midst of a talk they became more than ever anxious and perturbed.",
            "\u201cThat he was a splendid man is perfectly true; you are quite right,\u201d repeated Ivan Petrovitch, but seriously this time. \u201cHe was a fine and a worthy fellow\u2014worthy, one may say, of the highest respect,\u201d he added, more and more seriously at each pause; \u201cand it is agreeable to see, on your part, such\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWasn\u2019t it this same Pavlicheff about whom there was a strange story in connection with some abbot? I don\u2019t remember who the abbot was, but I remember at one time everybody was talking about it,\u201d remarked the old dignitary.",
            "\u201cYes\u2014Abbot Gurot, a Jesuit,\u201d said Ivan Petrovitch. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the sort of thing our best men are apt to do. A man of rank, too, and rich\u2014a man who, if he had continued to serve, might have done anything; and then to throw up the service and everything else in order to go over to Roman Catholicism and turn Jesuit\u2014openly, too\u2014almost triumphantly. By Jove! it was positively a mercy that he died when he did\u2014it was indeed\u2014everyone said so at the time.\u201d",
            "The prince was beside himself.",
            "\u201cPavlicheff?\u2014Pavlicheff turned Roman Catholic? Impossible!\u201d he cried, in horror.",
            "\u201cH\u2019m! impossible is rather a strong word,\u201d said Ivan Petrovitch. \u201cYou must allow, my dear prince... However, of course you value the memory of the deceased so very highly; and he certainly was the kindest of men; to which fact, by the way, I ascribe, more than to anything else, the success of the abbot in influencing his religious convictions. But you may ask me, if you please, how much trouble and worry I, personally, had over that business, and especially with this same Gurot! Would you believe it,\u201d he continued, addressing the dignitary, \u201cthey actually tried to put in a claim under the deceased\u2019s will, and I had to resort to the very strongest measures in order to bring them to their senses? I assure you they knew their cue, did these gentlemen\u2014wonderful! Thank goodness all this was in Moscow, and I got the Court, you know, to help me, and we soon brought them to their senses.\u201d",
            "\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how you have pained and astonished me,\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cVery sorry; but in point of fact, you know, it was all nonsense and would have ended in smoke, as usual\u2014I\u2019m sure of that. Last year,\u201d\u2014he turned to the old man again,\u2014\u201cCountess K. joined some Roman Convent abroad. Our people never seem to be able to offer any resistance so soon as they get into the hands of these\u2014intriguers\u2014especially abroad.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat is all thanks to our lassitude, I think,\u201d replied the old man, with authority. \u201cAnd then their way of preaching; they have a skilful manner of doing it! And they know how to startle one, too. I got quite a fright myself in \u201932, in Vienna, I assure you; but I didn\u2019t cave in to them, I ran away instead, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "\u201cCome, come, I\u2019ve always heard that you ran away with the beautiful Countess Levitsky that time\u2014throwing up everything in order to do it\u2014and not from the Jesuits at all,\u201d said Princess Bielokonski, suddenly.",
            "\u201cWell, yes\u2014but we call it from the Jesuits, you know; it comes to the same thing,\u201d laughed the old fellow, delighted with the pleasant recollection.",
            "\u201cYou seem to be very religious,\u201d he continued, kindly, addressing the prince, \u201cwhich is a thing one meets so seldom nowadays among young people.\u201d",
            "The prince was listening open-mouthed, and still in a condition of excited agitation. The old man was evidently interested in him, and anxious to study him more closely.",
            "\u201cPavlicheff was a man of bright intellect and a good Christian, a sincere Christian,\u201d said the prince, suddenly. \u201cHow could he possibly embrace a faith which is unchristian? Roman Catholicism is, so to speak, simply the same thing as unchristianity,\u201d he added with flashing eyes, which seemed to take in everybody in the room.",
            "\u201cCome, that\u2019s a little _too_ strong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d murmured the old man, glancing at General Epanchin in surprise.",
            "\u201cHow do you make out that the Roman Catholic religion is _unchristian?_ What is it, then?\u201d asked Ivan Petrovitch, turning to the prince.",
            "\u201cIt is not a Christian religion, in the first place,\u201d said the latter, in extreme agitation, quite out of proportion to the necessity of the moment. \u201cAnd in the second place, Roman Catholicism is, in my opinion, worse than Atheism itself. Yes\u2014that is my opinion. Atheism only preaches a negation, but Romanism goes further; it preaches a disfigured, distorted Christ\u2014it preaches Anti-Christ\u2014I assure you, I swear it! This is my own personal conviction, and it has long distressed me. The Roman Catholic believes that the Church on earth cannot stand without universal temporal Power. He cries \u2018non possumus!\u2019 In my opinion the Roman Catholic religion is not a faith at all, but simply a continuation of the Roman Empire, and everything is subordinated to this idea\u2014beginning with faith. The Pope has seized territories and an earthly throne, and has held them with the sword. And so the thing has gone on, only that to the sword they have added lying, intrigue, deceit, fanaticism, superstition, swindling;\u2014they have played fast and loose with the most sacred and sincere feelings of men;\u2014they have exchanged everything\u2014everything for money, for base earthly _power!_ And is this not the teaching of Anti-Christ? How could the upshot of all this be other than Atheism? Atheism is the child of Roman Catholicism\u2014it proceeded from these Romans themselves, though perhaps they would not believe it. It grew and fattened on hatred of its parents; it is the progeny of their lies and spiritual feebleness. Atheism! In our country it is only among the upper classes that you find unbelievers; men who have lost the root or spirit of their faith; but abroad whole masses of the people are beginning to profess unbelief\u2014at first because of the darkness and lies by which they were surrounded; but now out of fanaticism, out of loathing for the Church and Christianity!\u201d",
            "The prince paused to get breath. He had spoken with extraordinary rapidity, and was very pale.",
            "All present interchanged glances, but at last the old dignitary burst out laughing frankly. Prince N. took out his eye-glass to have a good look at the speaker. The German poet came out of his corner and crept nearer to the table, with a spiteful smile.",
            "\u201cYou exaggerate the matter very much,\u201d said Ivan Petrovitch, with rather a bored air. \u201cThere are, in the foreign Churches, many representatives of their faith who are worthy of respect and esteem.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, but I did not speak of individual representatives. I was merely talking about Roman Catholicism, and its essence\u2014of Rome itself. A Church can never entirely disappear; I never hinted at that!\u201d",
            "\u201cAgreed that all this may be true; but we need not discuss a subject which belongs to the domain of theology.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, no; oh, no! Not to theology alone, I assure you! Why, Socialism is the progeny of Romanism and of the Romanistic spirit. It and its brother Atheism proceed from Despair in opposition to Catholicism. It seeks to replace in itself the moral power of religion, in order to appease the spiritual thirst of parched humanity and save it; not by Christ, but by force. \u2018Don\u2019t dare to believe in God, don\u2019t dare to possess any individuality, any property! _Fraternit\u00e9 ou la Mort_; two million heads. \u2018By their works ye shall know them\u2019\u2014we are told. And we must not suppose that all this is harmless and without danger to ourselves. Oh, no; we must resist, and quickly, quickly! We must let our Christ shine forth upon the Western nations, our Christ whom we have preserved intact, and whom they have never known. Not as slaves, allowing ourselves to be caught by the hooks of the Jesuits, but carrying our Russian civilization to _them_, we must stand before them, not letting it be said among us that their preaching is \u2018skilful,\u2019 as someone expressed it just now.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut excuse me, excuse me;\u201d cried Ivan Petrovitch considerably disturbed, and looking around uneasily. \u201cYour ideas are, of course, most praiseworthy, and in the highest degree patriotic; but you exaggerate the matter terribly. It would be better if we dropped the subject.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, sir, I do not exaggerate, I understate the matter, if anything, undoubtedly understate it; simply because I cannot express myself as I should like, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cAllow me!\u201d",
            "The prince was silent. He sat straight up in his chair and gazed fervently at Ivan Petrovitch.",
            "\u201cIt seems to me that you have been too painfully impressed by the news of what happened to your good benefactor,\u201d said the old dignitary, kindly, and with the utmost calmness of demeanour. \u201cYou are excitable, perhaps as the result of your solitary life. If you would make up your mind to live more among your fellows in society, I trust, I am sure, that the world would be glad to welcome you, as a remarkable young man; and you would soon find yourself able to look at things more calmly. You would see that all these things are much simpler than you think; and, besides, these rare cases come about, in my opinion, from ennui and from satiety.\u201d",
            "\u201cExactly, exactly! That is a true thought!\u201d cried the prince. \u201cFrom ennui, from our ennui but not from satiety! Oh, no, you are wrong there! Say from _thirst_ if you like; the thirst of fever! And please do not suppose that this is so small a matter that we may have a laugh at it and dismiss it; we must be able to foresee our disasters and arm against them. We Russians no sooner arrive at the brink of the water, and realize that we are really at the brink, than we are so delighted with the outlook that in we plunge and swim to the farthest point we can see. Why is this? You say you are surprised at Pavlicheff\u2019s action; you ascribe it to madness, to kindness of heart, and what not, but it is not so.",
            "\u201cOur Russian intensity not only astonishes ourselves; all Europe wonders at our conduct in such cases! For, if one of us goes over to Roman Catholicism, he is sure to become a Jesuit at once, and a rabid one into the bargain. If one of us becomes an Atheist, he must needs begin to insist on the prohibition of faith in God by force, that is, by the sword. Why is this? Why does he then exceed all bounds at once? Because he has found land at last, the fatherland that he sought in vain before; and, because his soul is rejoiced to find it, he throws himself upon it and kisses it! Oh, it is not from vanity alone, it is not from feelings of vanity that Russians become Atheists and Jesuits! But from spiritual thirst, from anguish of longing for higher things, for dry firm land, for foothold on a fatherland which they never believed in because they never knew it. It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian \u2018become an Atheist,\u2019 but he actually _believes in_ Atheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a negation. Such is our anguish of thirst! \u2018Whoso has no country has no God.\u2019 That is not my own expression; it is the expression of a merchant, one of the Old Believers, whom I once met while travelling. He did not say exactly these words. I think his expression was:",
            "\u201c\u2018Whoso forsakes his country forsakes his God.\u2019",
            "\u201cBut let these thirsty Russian souls find, like Columbus\u2019 discoverers, a new world; let them find the Russian world, let them search and discover all the gold and treasure that lies hid in the bosom of their own land! Show them the restitution of lost humanity, in the future, by Russian thought alone, and by means of the God and of the Christ of our Russian faith, and you will see how mighty and just and wise and good a giant will rise up before the eyes of the astonished and frightened world; astonished because they expect nothing but the sword from us, because they think they will get nothing out of us but barbarism. This has been the case up to now, and the longer matters go on as they are now proceeding, the more clear will be the truth of what I say; and I\u2014\u201d",
            "But at this moment something happened which put a most unexpected end to the orator\u2019s speech. All this heated tirade, this outflow of passionate words and ecstatic ideas which seemed to hustle and tumble over each other as they fell from his lips, bore evidence of some unusually disturbed mental condition in the young fellow who had \u201cboiled over\u201d in such a remarkable manner, without any apparent reason.",
            "Of those who were present, such as knew the prince listened to his outburst in a state of alarm, some with a feeling of mortification. It was so unlike his usual timid self-constraint; so inconsistent with his usual taste and tact, and with his instinctive feeling for the higher proprieties. They could not understand the origin of the outburst; it could not be simply the news of Pavlicheff\u2019s perversion. By the ladies the prince was regarded as little better than a lunatic, and Princess Bielokonski admitted afterwards that \u201cin another minute she would have bolted.\u201d",
            "The two old gentlemen looked quite alarmed. The old general (Epanchin\u2019s chief) sat and glared at the prince in severe displeasure. The colonel sat immovable. Even the German poet grew a little pale, though he wore his usual artificial smile as he looked around to see what the others would do.",
            "In point of fact it is quite possible that the matter would have ended in a very commonplace and natural way in a few minutes. The undoubtedly astonished, but now more collected, General Epanchin had several times endeavoured to interrupt the prince, and not having succeeded he was now preparing to take firmer and more vigorous measures to attain his end. In another minute or two he would probably have made up his mind to lead the prince quietly out of the room, on the plea of his being ill (and it was more than likely that the general was right in his belief that the prince _was_ actually ill), but it so happened that destiny had something different in store.",
            "At the beginning of the evening, when the prince first came into the room, he had sat down as far as possible from the Chinese vase which Aglaya had spoken of the day before.",
            "Will it be believed that, after Aglaya\u2019s alarming words, an ineradicable conviction had taken possession of his mind that, however he might try to avoid this vase next day, he must certainly break it? But so it was.",
            "During the evening other impressions began to awaken in his mind, as we have seen, and he forgot his presentiment. But when Pavlicheff was mentioned and the general introduced him to Ivan Petrovitch, he had changed his place, and went over nearer to the table; when, it so happened, he took the chair nearest to the beautiful vase, which stood on a pedestal behind him, just about on a level with his elbow.",
            "As he spoke his last words he had risen suddenly from his seat with a wave of his arm, and there was a general cry of horror.",
            "The huge vase swayed backwards and forwards; it seemed to be uncertain whether or no to topple over on to the head of one of the old men, but eventually determined to go the other way, and came crashing over towards the German poet, who darted out of the way in terror.",
            "The crash, the cry, the sight of the fragments of valuable china covering the carpet, the alarm of the company\u2014what all this meant to the poor prince it would be difficult to convey to the mind of the reader, or for him to imagine.",
            "But one very curious fact was that all the shame and vexation and mortification which he felt over the accident were less powerful than the deep impression of the almost supernatural truth of his premonition. He stood still in alarm\u2014in almost superstitious alarm, for a moment; then all mists seemed to clear away from his eyes; he was conscious of nothing but light and joy and ecstasy; his breath came and went; but the moment passed. Thank God it was not that! He drew a long breath and looked around.",
            "For some minutes he did not seem to comprehend the excitement around him; that is, he comprehended it and saw everything, but he stood aside, as it were, like someone invisible in a fairy tale, as though he had nothing to do with what was going on, though it pleased him to take an interest in it.",
            "He saw them gather up the broken bits of china; he heard the loud talking of the guests and observed how pale Aglaya looked, and how very strangely she was gazing at him. There was no hatred in her expression, and no anger whatever. It was full of alarm for him, and sympathy and affection, while she looked around at the others with flashing, angry eyes. His heart filled with a sweet pain as he gazed at her.",
            "At length he observed, to his amazement, that all had taken their seats again, and were laughing and talking as though nothing had happened. Another minute and the laughter grew louder\u2014they were laughing at him, at his dumb stupor\u2014laughing kindly and merrily. Several of them spoke to him, and spoke so kindly and cordially, especially Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2014she was saying the kindest possible things to him.",
            "Suddenly he became aware that General Epanchin was tapping him on the shoulder; Ivan Petrovitch was laughing too, but still more kind and sympathizing was the old dignitary. He took the prince by the hand and pressed it warmly; then he patted it, and quietly urged him to recollect himself\u2014speaking to him exactly as he would have spoken to a little frightened child, which pleased the prince wonderfully; and next seated him beside himself.",
            "The prince gazed into his face with pleasure, but still seemed to have no power to speak. His breath failed him. The old man\u2019s face pleased him greatly.",
            "\u201cDo you really forgive me?\u201d he said at last. \u201cAnd\u2014and Lizabetha Prokofievna too?\u201d The laugh increased, tears came into the prince\u2019s eyes, he could not believe in all this kindness\u2014he was enchanted.",
            "\u201cThe vase certainly was a very beautiful one. I remember it here for fifteen years\u2014yes, quite that!\u201d remarked Ivan Petrovitch.",
            "\u201cOh, what a dreadful calamity! A wretched vase smashed, and a man half dead with remorse about it,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, loudly. \u201cWhat made you so dreadfully startled, Lef Nicolaievitch?\u201d she added, a little timidly. \u201cCome, my dear boy! cheer up. You really alarm me, taking the accident so to heart.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you forgive me all\u2014_all_, besides the vase, I mean?\u201d said the prince, rising from his seat once more, but the old gentleman caught his hand and drew him down again\u2014he seemed unwilling to let him go.",
            "\u201c_C\u2019est tr\u00e8s-curieux et c\u2019est tr\u00e8s-s\u00e9rieux_,\u201d he whispered across the table to Ivan Petrovitch, rather loudly. Probably the prince heard him.",
            "\u201cSo that I have not offended any of you? You will not believe how happy I am to be able to think so. It is as it should be. As if I _could_ offend anyone here! I should offend you again by even suggesting such a thing.\u201d",
            "\u201cCalm yourself, my dear fellow. You are exaggerating again; you really have no occasion to be so grateful to us. It is a feeling which does you great credit, but an exaggeration, for all that.\u201d",
            "\u201cI am not exactly thanking you, I am only feeling a growing admiration for you\u2014it makes me happy to look at you. I dare say I am speaking very foolishly, but I must speak\u2014I must explain, if it be out of nothing better than self-respect.\u201d",
            "All he said and did was abrupt, confused, feverish\u2014very likely the words he spoke, as often as not, were not those he wished to say. He seemed to inquire whether he _might_ speak. His eyes lighted on Princess Bielokonski.",
            "\u201cAll right, my friend, talk away, talk away!\u201d she remarked. \u201cOnly don\u2019t lose your breath; you were in such a hurry when you began, and look what you\u2019ve come to now! Don\u2019t be afraid of speaking\u2014all these ladies and gentlemen have seen far stranger people than yourself; you don\u2019t astonish _them_. You are nothing out-of-the-way remarkable, you know. You\u2019ve done nothing but break a vase, and give us all a fright.\u201d",
            "The prince listened, smiling.",
            "\u201cWasn\u2019t it you,\u201d he said, suddenly turning to the old gentleman, \u201cwho saved the student Porkunoff and a clerk called Shoabrin from being sent to Siberia, two or three months since?\u201d",
            "The old dignitary blushed a little, and murmured that the prince had better not excite himself further.",
            "\u201cAnd I have heard of _you_,\u201d continued the prince, addressing Ivan Petrovitch, \u201cthat when some of your villagers were burned out you gave them wood to build up their houses again, though they were no longer your serfs and had behaved badly towards you.\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, come, come! You are exaggerating,\u201d said Ivan Petrovitch, beaming with satisfaction, all the same. He was right, however, in this instance, for the report had reached the prince\u2019s ears in an incorrect form.",
            "\u201cAnd you, princess,\u201d he went on, addressing Princess Bielokonski, \u201cwas it not you who received me in Moscow, six months since, as kindly as though I had been your own son, in response to a letter from Lizabetha Prokofievna; and gave me one piece of advice, again as to your own son, which I shall never forget? Do you remember?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat are you making such a fuss about?\u201d said the old lady, with annoyance. \u201cYou are a good fellow, but very silly. One gives you a halfpenny, and you are as grateful as though one had saved your life. You think this is praiseworthy on your part, but it is not\u2014it is not, indeed.\u201d",
            "She seemed to be very angry, but suddenly burst out laughing, quite good-humouredly.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna\u2019s face brightened up, too; so did that of General Epanchin.",
            "\u201cI told you Lef Nicolaievitch was a man\u2014a man\u2014if only he would not be in such a hurry, as the princess remarked,\u201d said the latter, with delight.",
            "Aglaya alone seemed sad and depressed; her face was flushed, perhaps with indignation.",
            "\u201cHe really is very charming,\u201d whispered the old dignitary to Ivan Petrovitch.",
            "\u201cI came into this room with anguish in my heart,\u201d continued the prince, with ever-growing agitation, speaking quicker and quicker, and with increasing strangeness. \u201cI\u2014I was afraid of you all, and afraid of myself. I was most afraid of myself. When I returned to Petersburg, I promised myself to make a point of seeing our greatest men, and members of our oldest families\u2014the old families like my own. I am now among princes like myself, am I not? I wished to know you, and it was necessary, very, very necessary. I had always heard so much that was evil said of you all\u2014more evil than good; as to how small and petty were your interests, how absurd your habits, how shallow your education, and so on. There is so much written and said about you! I came here today with anxious curiosity; I wished to see for myself and form my own convictions as to whether it were true that the whole of this upper stratum of Russian society is _worthless_, has outlived its time, has existed too long, and is only fit to die\u2014and yet is dying with petty, spiteful warring against that which is destined to supersede it and take its place\u2014hindering the Coming Men, and knowing not that itself is in a dying condition. I did not fully believe in this view even before, for there never was such a class among us\u2014excepting perhaps at court, by accident\u2014or by uniform; but now there is not even that, is there? It has vanished, has it not?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, not a bit of it,\u201d said Ivan Petrovitch, with a sarcastic laugh.",
            "\u201cGood Lord, he\u2019s off again!\u201d said Princess Bielokonski, impatiently.",
            "\u201cLaissez-le dire! He is trembling all over,\u201d said the old man, in a warning whisper.",
            "The prince certainly was beside himself.",
            "\u201cWell? What have I seen?\u201d he continued. \u201cI have seen men of graceful simplicity of intellect; I have seen an old man who is not above speaking kindly and even _listening_ to a boy like myself; I see before me persons who can understand, who can forgive\u2014kind, good Russian hearts\u2014hearts almost as kind and cordial as I met abroad. Imagine how delighted I must have been, and how surprised! Oh, let me express this feeling! I have so often heard, and I have even believed, that in society there was nothing but empty forms, and that reality had vanished; but I now see for myself that this can never be the case _here_, among us\u2014it may be the order elsewhere, but not in Russia. Surely you are not all Jesuits and deceivers! I heard Prince N.\u2018s story just now. Was it not simple-minded, spontaneous humour? Could such words come from the lips of a man who is dead?\u2014a man whose heart and talents are dried up? Could dead men and women have treated me so kindly as you have all been treating me to-day? Is there not material for the future in all this\u2014for hope? Can such people fail to _understand?_ Can such men fall away from reality?\u201d",
            "\u201cOnce more let us beg you to be calm, my dear boy. We\u2019ll talk of all this another time\u2014I shall do so with the greatest pleasure, for one,\u201d said the old dignitary, with a smile.",
            "Ivan Petrovitch grunted and twisted round in his chair. General Epanchin moved nervously. The latter\u2019s chief had started a conversation with the wife of the dignitary, and took no notice whatever of the prince, but the old lady very often glanced at him, and listened to what he was saying.",
            "\u201cNo, I had better speak,\u201d continued the prince, with a new outburst of feverish emotion, and turning towards the old man with an air of confidential trustfulness. \u201cYesterday, Aglaya Ivanovna forbade me to talk, and even specified the particular subjects I must not touch upon\u2014she knows well enough that I am odd when I get upon these matters. I am nearly twenty-seven years old, and yet I know I am little better than a child. I have no right to express my ideas, and said so long ago. Only in Moscow, with Rogojin, did I ever speak absolutely freely! He and I read Pushkin together\u2014all his works. Rogojin knew nothing of Pushkin, had not even heard his name. I am always afraid of spoiling a great Thought or Idea by my absurd manner. I have no eloquence, I know. I always make the wrong gestures\u2014inappropriate gestures\u2014and therefore I degrade the Thought, and raise a laugh instead of doing my subject justice. I have no sense of proportion either, and that is the chief thing. I know it would be much better if I were always to sit still and say nothing. When I do so, I appear to be quite a sensible sort of a person, and what\u2019s more, I think about things. But now I must speak; it is better that I should. I began to speak because you looked so kindly at me; you have such a beautiful face. I promised Aglaya Ivanovna yesterday that I would not speak all the evening.\u201d",
            "\u201cReally?\u201d said the old man, smiling.",
            "\u201cBut, at times, I can\u2019t help thinking that I am wrong in feeling so about it, you know. Sincerity is more important than elocution, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
            "\u201cSometimes.\u201d",
            "\u201cI want to explain all to you\u2014everything\u2014everything! I know you think me Utopian, don\u2019t you\u2014an idealist? Oh, no! I\u2019m not, indeed\u2014my ideas are all so simple. You don\u2019t believe me? You are smiling. Do you know, I am sometimes very wicked\u2014for I lose my faith? This evening as I came here, I thought to myself, \u2018What shall I talk about? How am I to begin, so that they may be able to understand partially, at all events?\u2019 How afraid I was\u2014dreadfully afraid! And yet, how _could_ I be afraid\u2014was it not shameful of me? Was I afraid of finding a bottomless abyss of empty selfishness? Ah! that\u2019s why I am so happy at this moment, because I find there is no bottomless abyss at all\u2014but good, healthy material, full of life.",
            "\u201cIt is not such a very dreadful circumstance that we are odd people, is it? For we really are odd, you know\u2014careless, reckless, easily wearied of anything. We don\u2019t look thoroughly into matters\u2014don\u2019t care to understand things. We are all like this\u2014you and I, and all of them! Why, here are you, now\u2014you are not a bit angry with me for calling you \u2018odd,\u2019 are you? And, if so, surely there is good material in you? Do you know, I sometimes think it is a good thing to be odd. We can forgive one another more easily, and be more humble. No one can begin by being perfect\u2014there is much one cannot understand in life at first. In order to attain to perfection, one must begin by failing to understand much. And if we take in knowledge too quickly, we very likely are not taking it in at all. I say all this to you\u2014you who by this time understand so much\u2014and doubtless have failed to understand so much, also. I am not afraid of you any longer. You are not angry that a mere boy should say such words to you, are you? Of course not! You know how to forget and to forgive. You are laughing, Ivan Petrovitch? You think I am a champion of other classes of people\u2014that I am _their_ advocate, a democrat, and an orator of Equality?\u201d The prince laughed hysterically; he had several times burst into these little, short nervous laughs. \u201cOh, no\u2014it is for you, for myself, and for all of us together, that I am alarmed. I am a prince of an old family myself, and I am sitting among my peers; and I am talking like this in the hope of saving us all; in the hope that our class will not disappear altogether\u2014into the darkness\u2014unguessing its danger\u2014blaming everything around it, and losing ground every day. Why should we disappear and give place to others, when we may still, if we choose, remain in the front rank and lead the battle? Let us be servants, that we may become lords in due season!\u201d",
            "He tried to get upon his feet again, but the old man still restrained him, gazing at him with increasing perturbation as he went on.",
            "\u201cListen\u2014I know it is best not to speak! It is best simply to give a good example\u2014simply to begin the work. I have done this\u2014I have begun, and\u2014and\u2014oh! _can_ anyone be unhappy, really? Oh! what does grief matter\u2014what does misfortune matter, if one knows how to be happy? Do you know, I cannot understand how anyone can pass by a green tree, and not feel happy only to look at it! How anyone can talk to a man and not feel happy in loving him! Oh, it is my own fault that I cannot express myself well enough! But there are lovely things at every step I take\u2014things which even the most miserable man must recognize as beautiful. Look at a little child\u2014look at God\u2019s day dawn\u2014look at the grass growing\u2014look at the eyes that love you, as they gaze back into your eyes!\u201d",
            "He had risen, and was speaking standing up. The old gentleman was looking at him now in unconcealed alarm. Lizabetha Prokofievna wrung her hands. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d she cried. She had guessed the state of the case before anyone else.",
            "Aglaya rushed quickly up to him, and was just in time to receive him in her arms, and to hear with dread and horror that awful, wild cry as he fell writhing to the ground.",
            "There he lay on the carpet, and someone quickly placed a cushion under his head.",
            "No one had expected this.",
            "In a quarter of an hour or so Prince N. and Evgenie Pavlovitch and the old dignitary were hard at work endeavouring to restore the harmony of the evening, but it was of no avail, and very soon after the guests separated and went their ways.",
            "A great deal of sympathy was expressed; a considerable amount of advice was volunteered; Ivan Petrovitch expressed his opinion that the young man was \u201ca Slavophile, or something of that sort\u201d; but that it was not a dangerous development. The old dignitary said nothing.",
            "True enough, most of the guests, next day and the day after, were not in very good humour. Ivan Petrovitch was a little offended, but not seriously so. General Epanchin\u2019s chief was rather cool towards him for some while after the occurrence. The old dignitary, as patron of the family, took the opportunity of murmuring some kind of admonition to the general, and added, in flattering terms, that he was most interested in Aglaya\u2019s future. He was a man who really did possess a kind heart, although his interest in the prince, in the earlier part of the evening, was due, among other reasons, to the latter\u2019s connection with Nastasia Philipovna, according to popular report. He had heard a good deal of this story here and there, and was greatly interested in it, so much so that he longed to ask further questions about it.",
            "Princess Bielokonski, as she drove away on this eventful evening, took occasion to say to Lizabetha Prokofievna:",
            "\u201cWell\u2014he\u2019s a good match\u2014and a bad one; and if you want my opinion, more bad than good. You can see for yourself the man is an invalid.\u201d",
            "Lizabetha therefore decided that the prince was impossible as a husband for Aglaya; and during the ensuing night she made a vow that never while she lived should he marry Aglaya. With this resolve firmly impressed upon her mind, she awoke next day; but during the morning, after her early lunch, she fell into a condition of remarkable inconsistency.",
            "In reply to a very guarded question of her sisters\u2019, Aglaya had answered coldly, but exceedingly haughtily:",
            "\u201cI have never given him my word at all, nor have I ever counted him as my future husband\u2014never in my life. He is just as little to me as all the rest.\u201d",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly flared up.",
            "\u201cI did not expect that of you, Aglaya,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is an impossible husband for you,\u2014I know it; and thank God that we agree upon that point; but I did not expect to hear such words from you. I thought I should hear a very different tone from you. I would have turned out everyone who was in the room last night and kept him,\u2014that\u2019s the sort of man he is, in my opinion!\u201d",
            "Here she suddenly paused, afraid of what she had just said. But she little knew how unfair she was to her daughter at that moment. It was all settled in Aglaya\u2019s mind. She was only waiting for the hour that would bring the matter to a final climax; and every hint, every careless probing of her wound, did but further lacerate her heart. "

            "His attack of yesterday had been a slight one. Excepting some little heaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any particular effects. His brain worked all right, though his soul was heavy within him.",
            "He rose late, and immediately upon waking remembered all about the previous evening; he also remembered, though not quite so clearly, how, half an hour after his fit, he had been carried home.",
            "He soon heard that a messenger from the Epanchins\u2019 had already been to inquire after him. At half-past eleven another arrived; and this pleased him.",
            "Vera Lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her services. No sooner did she catch sight of him than she burst into tears; but when he tried to soothe her she began to laugh. He was quite struck by the girl\u2019s deep sympathy for him; he seized her hand and kissed it. Vera flushed crimson.",
            "\u201cOh, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201d she exclaimed in alarm, snatching her hand away. She went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion.",
            "Lebedeff also came to see the prince, in a great hurry to get away to the \u201cdeceased,\u201d as he called General Ivolgin, who was alive still, but very ill. Colia also turned up, and begged the prince for pity\u2019s sake to tell him all he knew about his father which had been concealed from him till now. He said he had found out nearly everything since yesterday; the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction. With all the sympathy which he could bring into play, the prince told Colia the whole story without reserve, detailing the facts as clearly as he could. The tale struck Colia like a thunderbolt. He could not speak. He listened silently, and cried softly to himself the while. The prince perceived that this was an impression which would last for the whole of the boy\u2019s life. He made haste to explain his view of the matter, and pointed out that the old man\u2019s approaching death was probably brought on by horror at the thought of his action; and that it was not everyone who was capable of such a feeling.",

Oh, prince, I have felt much that is quite new to me since yesterday! It is a lesson for me. I shall now consider my mother as entirely my responsibility; though she may be safe enough with Varia. Still, meat and drink is not everything.\u201d",
            "He jumped up and hurried off, remembering suddenly that he was wanted at his father\u2019s bedside; but before he went out of the room he inquired hastily after the prince\u2019s health, and receiving the latter\u2019s reply, added:",
            "\u201cIsn\u2019t there something else, prince? I heard yesterday, but I have no right to talk about this... If you ever want a true friend and servant\u2014neither you nor I are so very happy, are we?\u2014come to me. I won\u2019t ask you questions, though.\u201d",
            "He ran off and left the prince more dejected than ever.",
            "Everyone seemed to be speaking prophetically, hinting at some misfortune or sorrow to come; they had all looked at him as though they knew something which he did not know. Lebedeff had asked questions, Colia had hinted, and Vera had shed tears. What was it?",
            "At last, with a sigh of annoyance, he said to himself that it was nothing but his own cursed sickly suspicion. His face lighted up with joy when, at about two o\u2019clock, he espied the Epanchins coming along to pay him a short visit, \u201cjust for a minute.\u201d They really had only come for a minute.",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they would all take a walk together. The information was given in the form of a command, without explanation, drily and abruptly. All had issued forth in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and Prince S. Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly contrary to the usual one, and all understood very well what she was driving at, but held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady. She, as though anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent and alone. At last Adelaida remarked that it was no use racing along at such a pace, and that she could not keep up with her mother.",
            "\u201cLook here,\u201d said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; \u201cwe are passing his house. Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of anything that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he is ill and in misfortune. I, for one, shall call in and see him. Let anyone follow me who cares to.\u201d",
            "Of course every one of them followed her.",
            "The prince hastened to apologize, very properly, for yesterday\u2019s mishap with the vase, and for the scene generally.",
            "\u201cOh, that\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Lizabetha; \u201cI\u2019m not sorry for the vase, I\u2019m sorry for you. H\u2019m! so you can see that there was a \u2018scene,\u2019 can you? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter much, for everyone must realize now that it is impossible to be hard on you. Well, _au revoir_. I advise you to have a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual, if you feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens, and whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of the family\u2014mine, at all events. I can answer for myself.\u201d",
            "In response to this challenge all the others chimed in and re-echoed mamma\u2019s sentiments.",
            "And so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed visit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna never dreamed of. In the words \u201cas usual,\u201d and again in her added, \u201cmine, at all events,\u201d there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to come.",
            "The prince began to think of Aglaya. She had certainly given him a wonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not said a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship for him. She had looked very intently at him, but that was all. Her face had been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept badly.",
            "The prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there \u201cas usual,\u201d tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch.",
            "Vera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left. \u201cLef Nicolaievitch,\u201d she said, \u201cAglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message for you.\u201d",
            "The prince trembled.",
            "\u201cIs it a note?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that. She begs you earnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day, until seven o\u2019clock in the evening. It may have been nine; I didn\u2019t quite hear.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut\u2014but, why is this? What does it mean?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.\u201d",
            "\u201cDid she say that?\u201d",
            "\u201cNot those very words. She only just had time to whisper as she went by; but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important. She looked at me in a way that made my heart stop beating.\u201d",
            "The prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing else, he became more and more agitated.",
            "Left alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think.",
            "\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he thought, \u201csomeone is to be with them until nine tonight and she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in public.\u201d So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at his watch. But the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the evening, and came in the form of a new and agonizing riddle.",
            "Half an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired that, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a fit of coughing that he could not stop. He coughed till the blood came. His eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and brighter. The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only signed that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent. At last he came to himself.",
            "\u201cI am off,\u201d he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty.",
            "\u201cShall I see you home?\u201d asked the prince, rising from his seat, but suddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglaya\u2019s prohibition against leaving the house. Hippolyte laughed.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t mean that I am going to leave your house,\u201d he continued, still gasping and coughing. \u201cOn the contrary, I thought it absolutely necessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled you. I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that I am off! It\u2019s all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me. I lay down this morning at ten o\u2019clock with the intention of not rising again before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more in order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason for wishing to come.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte. Why didn\u2019t you send me a message? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, well! Enough! You\u2019ve pitied me, and that\u2019s all that good manners exact. I forgot, how are you?\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019m all right; yesterday I was a little\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI know, I heard; the china vase caught it! I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019ve come about something important. In the first place I had, the pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see what a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when he had gone. I don\u2019t think anything ever surprises you, prince!\u201d added Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the prince\u2019s calm demeanour. \u201cTo be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect. In my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great foolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me! I am very unfortunate today in my expressions.\u201d",
            "\u201cI knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch\u2014\u201d began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise.",
            "\u201cYou knew it? Come, that\u2019s news! But no\u2014perhaps better not tell me. And were you a witness of the meeting?\u201d",
            "\u201cIf you were there yourself you must have known that I was _not_ there!\u201d",
            "\u201cOh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to be afraid that Mr. Gania\u2014might have the preference!\u201d",
            "\u201cMay I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use such expressions?\u201d",
            "\u201cEspecially as you know all, eh?\u201d",
            "\u201cYou are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You say there was a meeting. Very well; let\u2019s leave it so\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know nothing! You say \u2018very well; let\u2019s leave it so.\u2019 But I say, don\u2019t be so confiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply _because_ you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have in their minds\u2019 eye\u2014Gania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious? Well, well, I\u2019ll drop the subject!\u201d he added, hastily, observing the prince\u2019s impatient gesture. \u201cBut I\u2019ve come to you on my own business; I wish to make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one cannot die without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them already. Do you wish to hear what I have to say?\u201d",
            "\u201cSpeak away, I am listening.\u201d",
            "\u201cVery well, but I\u2019ll change my mind, and begin about Gania. Just fancy to begin with, if you can, that I, too, was given an appointment at the green bench today! However, I won\u2019t deceive you; I asked for the appointment. I said I had a secret to disclose. I don\u2019t know whether I came there too early, I think I must have; but scarcely had I sat down beside Aglaya Ivanovna than I saw Gavrila Ardalionovitch and his sister Varia coming along, arm in arm, just as though they were enjoying a morning walk together. Both of them seemed very much astonished, not to say disturbed, at seeing me; they evidently had not expected the pleasure. Aglaya Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little confused. I don\u2019t know whether it was merely because I was there, or whether Gania\u2019s beauty was too much for her! But anyway, she turned crimson, and then finished up the business in a very funny manner. She jumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and suddenly observed: \u2018I only came here to express my gratitude for all your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your services, believe me\u2014\u2019 Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they both marched off again, looking very foolish. Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.\u201d",
            "\u201cNastasia Philipovna!\u201d cried the prince.",
            "\u201cAha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings, for once. I\u2019ll console you a little now, after your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!\u201d",
            "\u201cA\u2014a moral one?\u201d asked the prince, involuntarily.",
            "\u201cYes\u2014not a physical one! I don\u2019t suppose anyone\u2014even a woman\u2014would raise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate! I did think at one time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though. I bet anything that I know what you are thinking of now! You are thinking: \u2018Of course one can\u2019t strike the little wretch, but one could suffocate him with a pillow, or a wet towel, when he is asleep! One _ought_ to get rid of him somehow.\u2019 I can see in your face that you are thinking that at this very second.\u201d",
            "\u201cI never thought of such a thing for a moment,\u201d said the prince, with disgust.",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I dreamed last night that I was being suffocated with a wet cloth by\u2014somebody. I\u2019ll tell you who it was\u2014Rogojin! What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve heard so. Well, we\u2019ll leave that question just now. Why am I a scandal-monger? Why did she call me a scandal-monger? And mind, _after_ she had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of questions besides\u2014but such is the way of women. For _her_ sake I entered into relations with Rogojin\u2014an interesting man! At _her_ request I arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia Philipovna. Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was enjoying Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s \u2018leavings\u2019? Why, I have been impressing it upon her all this while for her own good. Two letters have I written her in that strain, and I began straight off today about its being humiliating for her. Besides, the word \u2018leavings\u2019 is not my invention. At all events, they all used it at Gania\u2019s, and she used it herself. So why am I a scandal-monger? I see\u2014I see you are tremendously amused, at this moment! Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to my case\u2014",

            "\u201cOh\u2014come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here\u2014at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s\u2014that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems.

Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room it\u2019s known all over the place here. However, I\u2019ve warned you, and you may be grateful to me. Well\u2014_au revoir_\u2014probably in the next world! One more thing\u2014don\u2019t think that I am telling you all this for your sake. Oh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya Ivanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am not acting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved like a cad to you, I have not done _her_ any harm. I don\u2019t apologize for my words about \u2018leavings\u2019 and all that. I am atoning for that, you see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting. Goodbye! You had better take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man! The meeting is fixed for this evening\u2014that\u2019s certain.\u201d",

            "\u201cI don\u2019t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,\u201d replied Hippolyte, looking round. \u201cNastasia would hardly go to her; and they can\u2019t meet at Gania\u2019s, with a man nearly dead in the house.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, for that very reason,\u201d said the prince. \u201cHow would she get out if she wished to? You don\u2019t know the habits of that house\u2014she _could_ not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s! It\u2019s all nonsense!\u201d",

When the moment comes, and there\u2019s nothing else to be done\u2014our young lady will go to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s! Don\u2019t they let the young ladies out of the house alone, then?\u201d",

            "\u201cIf you didn\u2019t mean that, then she has only to go down the steps and walk off, and she need never come back unless she chooses: Ships are burned behind one sometimes, and one doesn\u2019t care to return whence one came. Life need not consist only of lunches, and dinners, and Prince S\u2019s. It strikes me you take Aglaya Ivanovna for some conventional boarding-school girl. I said so to her, and she quite agreed with me. Wait till seven or eight o\u2019clock. In your place I would send someone there to keep watch, so as to seize the exact moment when she steps out of the house. Send Colia. He\u2019ll play the spy with pleasure\u2014for you at least. Ha, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "Hippolyte went out.",
            "There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he had been capable of such a thing. Aglaya\u2019s command that he should stay at home all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call for him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to make sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at home. His head whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round. He lay down on the sofa, and closed his eyes.",
            "One way or the other the question was to be decided at last\u2014finally.",
            "Oh, no, he did not think of Aglaya as a boarding-school miss, or a young lady of the conventional type! He had long since feared that she might take some such step as this. But why did she wish to see Nastasia?",
            "He shivered all over as he lay; he was in high fever again.",
            "No! he did not account her a child. Certain of her looks, certain of her words, of late, had filled him with apprehension. At times it had struck him that she was putting too great a restraint upon herself, and he remembered that he had been alarmed to observe this. He had tried, all these days, to drive away the heavy thoughts that oppressed him; but what was the hidden mystery of that soul? The question had long tormented him, although he implicitly trusted that soul. And now it was all to be cleared up. It was a dreadful thought. And \u201cthat woman\u201d again! Why did he always feel as though \u201cthat woman\u201d were fated to appear at each critical moment of his life, and tear the thread of his destiny like a bit of rotten string? That he always _had_ felt this he was ready to swear, although he was half delirious at the moment. If he had tried to forget her, all this time, it was simply because he was afraid of her. Did he love the woman or hate her? This question he did not once ask himself today; his heart was quite pure. He knew whom he loved. He was not so much afraid of this meeting, nor of its strangeness, nor of any reasons there might be for it, unknown to himself; he was afraid of the woman herself, Nastasia Philipovna. He remembered, some days afterwards, how during all those fevered hours he had seen but _her_ eyes, _her_ look, had heard _her_ voice, strange words of hers; he remembered that this was so, although he could not recollect the details of his thoughts.",
            "He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took it; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect.",
            "He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went to meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then.",
            "Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light mantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes were ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that expression in her eyes before.",
            "She gazed attentively at him.",
            "\u201cYou are quite ready, I observe,\u201d she said, with absolute composure, \u201cdressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to warn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, he told me,\u201d said the prince, feeling only half alive.",
            "\u201cCome then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there? You are well enough to go out, aren\u2019t you?\u201d",
            "\u201cI am well enough; but is it really possible?\u2014\u201d",
            "He broke off abruptly, and could not add another word. This was his one attempt to stop the mad child, and, after he had made it, he followed her as though he had no will of his own. Confused as his thoughts were, he was, nevertheless, capable of realizing the fact that if he did not go with her, she would go alone, and so he must go with her at all hazards. He guessed the strength of her determination; it was beyond him to check it.",
            "They walked silently, and said scarcely a word all the way. He only noticed that she seemed to know the road very well; and once, when he thought it better to go by a certain lane, and remarked to her that it would be quieter and less public, she only said, \u201cit\u2019s all the same,\u201d and went on.",
            "When they were almost arrived at Daria Alexeyevna\u2019s house (it was a large wooden structure of ancient date), a gorgeously-dressed lady and a young girl came out of it. Both these ladies took their seats in a carriage, which was waiting at the door, talking and laughing loudly the while, and drove away without appearing to notice the approaching couple.",
            "No sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more; and Rogojin, who had apparently been awaiting them, let them in and closed it after them.",
            "\u201cThere is not another soul in the house now excepting our four selves,\u201d he said aloud, looking at the prince in a strange way.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went into. She was dressed very simply, in black.",
            "She rose at their entrance, but did not smile or give her hand, even to the prince. Her anxious eyes were fixed upon Aglaya. Both sat down, at a little distance from one another\u2014Aglaya on the sofa, in the corner of the room, Nastasia by the window. The prince and Rogojin remained standing, and were not invited to sit.",
            "Muishkin glanced at Rogojin in perplexity, but the latter only smiled disagreeably, and said nothing. The silence continued for some few moments.",
            "An ominous expression passed over Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s face, of a sudden. It became obstinate-looking, hard, and full of hatred; but she did not take her eyes off her visitors for a moment.",
            "Aglaya was clearly confused, but not frightened. On entering she had merely glanced momentarily at her rival, and then had sat still, with her eyes on the ground, apparently in thought. Once or twice she glanced casually round the room. A shade of disgust was visible in her expression; she looked as though she were afraid of contamination in this place.",
            "She mechanically arranged her dress, and fidgeted uncomfortably, eventually changing her seat to the other end of the sofa. Probably she was unconscious of her own movements; but this very unconsciousness added to the offensiveness of their suggested meaning.",
            "At length she looked straight into Nastasia\u2019s eyes, and instantly read all there was to read in her rival\u2019s expression. Woman understood woman! Aglaya shuddered.",
            "\u201cYou know of course why I requested this meeting?\u201d she said at last, quietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence.",
            "\u201cNo\u2014I know nothing about it,\u201d said Nastasia, drily and abruptly.",
            "Aglaya blushed. Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible that she should really be sitting here and waiting for \u201cthat woman\u2019s\u201d reply to her question.",
            "At the first sound of Nastasia\u2019s voice a shudder ran through her frame. Of course \u201cthat woman\u201d observed and took in all this.",
            "\u201cYou know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,\u201d said Aglaya, very low, with her eyes on the ground.",
            "\u201cWhy should I?\u201d asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly.",
            "\u201cYou want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your house,\u201d continued Aglaya, awkwardly.",
            "\u201cFor that position _you_ are to blame and not I,\u201d said Nastasia, flaring up suddenly. \u201c_I_ did not invite _you_, but you me; and to this moment I am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.\u201d",
            "Aglaya raised her head haughtily.",
            "\u201cRestrain your tongue!\u201d she said. \u201cI did not come here to fight you with your own weapons.",
            "\u201cOh! then you did come \u2018to fight,\u2019 I may conclude? Dear me!\u2014and I thought you were cleverer\u2014\u201d",
            "They looked at one another with undisguised malice. One of these women had written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and it all was dispersed at their first meeting. Yet it appeared that not one of the four persons in the room considered this in any degree strange.",
            "The prince who, up to yesterday, would not have believed that he could even dream of such an impossible scene as this, stood and listened and looked on, and felt as though he had long foreseen it all. The most fantastic dream seemed suddenly to have been metamorphosed into the most vivid reality.",
            "One of these women so despised the other, and so longed to express her contempt for her (perhaps she had only come for that very purpose, as Rogojin said next day), that howsoever fantastical was the other woman, howsoever afflicted her spirit and disturbed her understanding, no preconceived idea of hers could possibly stand up against that deadly feminine contempt of her rival. The prince felt sure that Nastasia would say nothing about the letters herself; but he could judge by her flashing eyes and the expression of her face what the thought of those letters must be costing her at this moment. He would have given half his life to prevent Aglaya from speaking of them. But Aglaya suddenly braced herself up, and seemed to master herself fully, all in an instant.",
            "\u201cYou have not quite understood,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not come to quarrel with you, though I do not like you. I came to speak to you as... as one human being to another. I came with my mind made up as to what I had to say to you, and I shall not change my intention, although you may misunderstand me. So much the worse for you, not for myself! I wished to reply to all you have written to me and to reply personally, because I think that is the more convenient way. Listen to my reply to all your letters. I began to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very day I made his acquaintance, and when I heard\u2014afterwards\u2014of all that took place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he was such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his soul, believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character. What I feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured him, and threw him over. You could not love him because you are too proud\u2014no, not proud, that is an error; because you are too vain\u2014no, not quite that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness. Your letters to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a soul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at him. All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that you were disgraced and insulted. If you were less shameful, or had no cause at all for shame, you would be still more unhappy than you are now.\u201d",
            "Aglaya brought out these thronging words with great satisfaction. They came from her lips hurriedly and impetuously, and had been prepared and thought out long ago, even before she had ever dreamed of the present meeting. She watched with eagerness the effect of her speech as shown in Nastasia\u2019s face, which was distorted with agitation.",
            "\u201cYou remember,\u201d she continued, \u201che wrote me a letter at that time; he says you know all about that letter and that you even read it. I understand all by means of this letter, and understand it correctly. He has since confirmed it all to me\u2014what I now say to you, word for word. After receiving his letter I waited; I guessed that you would soon come back here, because you could never do without Petersburg; you are still too young and lovely for the provinces. However, this is not my own idea,\u201d she added, blushing dreadfully; and from this moment the colour never left her cheeks to the end of her speech. \u201cWhen I next saw the prince I began to feel terribly pained and hurt on his account. Do not laugh; if you laugh you are unworthy of understanding what I say.\u201d",
            "\u201cSurely you see that I am not laughing,\u201d said Nastasia, sadly and sternly.",
            "\u201cHowever, it\u2019s all the same to me; laugh or not, just as you please. When I asked him about you, he told me that he had long since ceased to love you, that the very recollection of you was a torture to him, but that he was sorry for you; and that when he thought of you his heart was pierced. I ought to tell you that I never in my life met a man anything like him for noble simplicity of mind and for boundless trustfulness. I guessed that anyone who liked could deceive him, and that he would immediately forgive anyone who did deceive him; and it was for this that I grew to love him\u2014\u201d",
            "Aglaya paused for a moment, as though suddenly brought up in astonishment that she could have said these words, but at the same time a great pride shone in her eyes, like a defiant assertion that it would not matter to her if \u201cthis woman\u201d laughed in her face for the admission just made.",
            "\u201cI have told you all now, and of course you understand what I wish of you.\u201d",
            "\u201cPerhaps I do; but tell me yourself,\u201d said Nastasia Philipovna, quietly.",
            "Aglaya flushed up angrily.",
            "\u201cI wished to find out from you,\u201d she said, firmly, \u201cby what right you dare to meddle with his feelings for me? By what right you dared send me those letters? By what right do you continually remind both me and him that you love him, after you yourself threw him over and ran away from him in so insulting and shameful a way?\u201d",
            "\u201cI never told either him or you that I loved him!\u201d replied Nastasia Philipovna, with an effort. \u201cAnd\u2014and I did run away from him\u2014you are right there,\u201d she added, scarcely audibly.",
            "\u201cNever told either him or me?\u201d cried Aglaya. \u201cHow about your letters? Who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him? Was not that a declaration from you? Why do you force yourself upon us in this way? I confess I thought at first that you were anxious to arouse an aversion for him in my heart by your meddling, in order that I might give him up; and it was only afterwards that I guessed the truth. You imagined that you were doing an heroic action! How could you spare any love for him, when you love your own vanity to such an extent? Why could you not simply go away from here, instead of writing me those absurd letters? Why do you not _now_ marry that generous man who loves you, and has done you the honour of offering you his hand? It is plain enough why; if you marry Rogojin you lose your grievance; you will have nothing more to complain of. You will be receiving too much honour. Evgenie Pavlovitch was saying the other day that you had read too many poems and are too well educated for\u2014your position; and that you live in idleness. Add to this your vanity, and, there you have reason enough\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd do you not live in idleness?\u201d",
            "Things had come to this unexpected point too quickly. Unexpected because Nastasia Philipovna, on her way to Pavlofsk, had thought and considered a good deal, and had expected something different, though perhaps not altogether good, from this interview; but Aglaya had been carried away by her own outburst, just as a rolling stone gathers impetus as it careers downhill, and could not restrain herself in the satisfaction of revenge.",
            "It was strange, Nastasia Philipovna felt, to see Aglaya like this. She gazed at her, and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment or two.",
            "Whether she were a woman who had read too many poems, as Evgenie Pavlovitch supposed, or whether she were mad, as the prince had assured Aglaya, at all events, this was a woman who, in spite of her occasionally cynical and audacious manner, was far more refined and trustful and sensitive than appeared. There was a certain amount of romantic dreaminess and caprice in her, but with the fantastic was mingled much that was strong and deep.",
            "The prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his face.",
            "Aglaya observed it, and trembled with anger.",
            "\u201cHow dare you speak so to me?\u201d she said, with a haughtiness which was quite indescribable, replying to Nastasia\u2019s last remark.",
            "\u201cYou must have misunderstood what I said,\u201d said Nastasia, in some surprise.",
            "\u201cIf you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up your\u2014your \u2018guardian,\u2019 Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?\u201d said Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing.",
            "\u201cWhat do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?\u201d cried Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white.",
            "\u201cI know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I don\u2019t wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.\u201d",
            "\u201cSilence!\u201d cried Nastasia Philipovna. \u201cYou are about as fit to understand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover in court the other day. She would understand me better than you do.\u201d",
            "\u201cProbably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?\u201d",
            "\u201cI do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.\u201d",
            "\u201cIf you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a laundress.\u201d",
            "Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces.",
            "\u201cAglaya, don\u2019t! This is unfair,\u201d cried the prince, deeply distressed.",
            "Rogojin was not smiling now; he sat and listened with folded arms, and lips tight compressed.",
            "\u201cThere, look at her,\u201d cried Nastasia, trembling with passion. \u201cLook at this young lady! And I imagined her an angel! Did you come to me without your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna? Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today? Shall I tell you without any embellishments? You came because you were afraid of me!\u201d",
            "\u201cAfraid of _you?_\u201d asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement that the other should dare talk to her like this.",
            "\u201cYes, me, of course! Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not have decided to come. You cannot despise one you fear. And to think that I have actually esteemed you up to this very moment! Do you know why you are afraid of me, and what is your object now? You wished to satisfy yourself with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself or you, because you are fearfully jealous.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe has told me already that he hates you,\u201d murmured Aglaya, scarcely audibly.",
            "\u201cPerhaps, perhaps! I am not worthy of him, I know. But I think you are lying, all the same. He cannot hate me, and he cannot have said so. I am ready to forgive you, in consideration of your position; but I confess I thought better of you. I thought you were wiser, and more beautiful, too; I did, indeed! Well, take your treasure! See, he is gazing at you, he can\u2019t recollect himself. Take him, but on one condition; go away at once, this instant!\u201d",
            "She fell back into a chair, and burst into tears. But suddenly some new expression blazed in her eyes. She stared fixedly at Aglaya, and rose from her seat.",
            "\u201cOr would you like me to bid him, _bid him_, do you hear, _command him_, now, at once, to throw you up, and remain mine for ever? Shall I? He will stay, and he will marry me too, and you shall trot home all alone. Shall I?\u2014shall I say the word?\u201d she screamed like a madwoman, scarcely believing herself that she could really pronounce such wild words.",
            "Aglaya had made for the door in terror, but she stopped at the threshold, and listened. \u201cShall I turn Rogojin off? Ha! ha! you thought I would marry him for your benefit, did you? Why, I\u2019ll call out _now_, if you like, in your presence, \u2018Rogojin, get out!\u2019 and say to the prince, \u2018Do you remember what you promised me?\u2019 Heavens! what a fool I have been to humiliate myself before them! Why, prince, you yourself gave me your word that you would marry me whatever happened, and would never abandon me. You said you loved me and would forgive me all, and\u2014and resp\u2014yes, you even said that! I only ran away from you in order to set you free, and now I don\u2019t care to let you go again. Why does she treat me so\u2014so shamefully? I am not a loose woman\u2014ask Rogojin there! He\u2019ll tell you. Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before your eyes, too; turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm? May you be accursed too, for you were the only one I trusted among them all! Go away, Rogojin, I don\u2019t want you,\u201d she continued, blind with fury, and forcing the words out with dry lips and distorted features, evidently not believing a single word of her own tirade, but, at the same time, doing her utmost to prolong the moment of self-deception.",
            "The outburst was so terribly violent that the prince thought it would have killed her.",
            "\u201cThere he is!\u201d she shrieked again, pointing to the prince and addressing Aglaya. \u201cThere he is! and if he does not approach me at once and take _me_ and throw you over, then have him for your own\u2014I give him up to you! I don\u2019t want him!\u201d",
            "Both she and Aglaya stood and waited as though in expectation, and both looked at the prince like madwomen.",
            "But he, perhaps, did not understand the full force of this challenge; in fact, it is certain he did not. All he could see was the poor despairing face which, as he had said to Aglaya, \u201chad pierced his heart for ever.\u201d",
            "He could bear it no longer, and with a look of entreaty, mingled with reproach, he addressed Aglaya, pointing to Nastasia the while:",
            "\u201cHow can you?\u201d he murmured; \u201cshe is so unhappy.\u201d",
            "But he had no time to say another word before Aglaya\u2019s terrible look bereft him of speech. In that look was embodied so dreadful a suffering and so deadly a hatred, that he gave a cry and flew to her; but it was too late.",
            "She could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her direction. She had hidden her face in her hands, cried once \u201cOh, my God!\u201d and rushed out of the room. Rogojin followed her to undo the bolts of the door and let her out into the street.",
            "The prince made a rush after her, but he was caught and held back. The distorted, livid face of Nastasia gazed at him reproachfully, and her blue lips whispered:",
            "\u201cWhat? Would you go to her\u2014to her?\u201d",
            "She fell senseless into his arms.",
            "He raised her, carried her into the room, placed her in an arm-chair, and stood over her, stupefied. On the table stood a tumbler of water. Rogojin, who now returned, took this and sprinkled a little in her face. She opened her eyes, but for a moment she understood nothing.",
            "Suddenly she looked around, shuddered, gave a loud cry, and threw herself in the prince\u2019s arms.",
            "\u201cMine, mine!\u201d she cried. \u201cHas the proud young lady gone? Ha, ha, ha!\u201d she laughed hysterically. \u201cAnd I had given him up to her! Why\u2014why did I? Mad\u2014mad! Get away, Rogojin! Ha, ha, ha!\u201d",
            "Rogojin stared intently at them; then he took his hat, and without a word, left the room.",
            "A few moments later, the prince was seated by Nastasia on the sofa, gazing into her eyes and stroking her face and hair, as he would a little child\u2019s. He laughed when she laughed, and was ready to cry when she cried. He did not speak, but listened to her excited, disconnected chatter, hardly understanding a word of it the while. No sooner did he detect the slightest appearance of complaining, or weeping, or reproaching, than he would smile at her kindly, and begin stroking her hair and her cheeks, soothing and consoling her once more, as if she were a child. "

        "IX.": [
            "During the next fortnight\u2014that is, through the early part of July\u2014the history of our hero was circulated in the form of strange, diverting, most unlikely-sounding stories, which passed from mouth to mouth, through the streets and villas adjoining those inhabited by Lebedeff, Ptitsin, Nastasia Philipovna and the Epanchins; in fact, pretty well through the whole town and its environs. All society\u2014both the inhabitants of the place and those who came down of an evening for the music\u2014had got hold of one and the same story, in a thousand varieties of detail\u2014as to how a certain young prince had raised a terrible scandal in a most respectable household, had thrown over a daughter of the family, to whom he was engaged, and had been captured by a woman of shady reputation whom he was determined to marry at once\u2014breaking off all old ties for the satisfaction of his insane idea; and, in spite of the public indignation roused by his action, the marriage was to take place in Pavlofsk openly and publicly, and the prince had announced his intention of going through with it with head erect and looking the whole world in the face. The story was so artfully adorned with scandalous details, and persons of so great eminence and importance were apparently mixed up in it, while, at the same time, the evidence was so circumstantial, that it was no wonder the matter gave food for plenty of curiosity and gossip.",
            "According to the reports of the most talented gossip-mongers\u2014those who, in every class of society, are always in haste to explain every event to their neighbours\u2014the young gentleman concerned was of good family\u2014a prince\u2014fairly rich\u2014weak of intellect, but a democrat and a dabbler in the Nihilism of the period, as exposed by Mr. Turgenieff. He could hardly talk Russian, but had fallen in love with one of the Miss Epanchins, and his suit met with so much encouragement that he had been received in the house as the recognized bridegroom-to-be of the young lady. But like the Frenchman of whom the story is told that he studied for holy orders, took all the oaths, was ordained priest, and next morning wrote to his bishop informing him that, as he did not believe in God and considered it wrong to deceive the people and live upon their pockets, he begged to surrender the orders conferred upon him the day before, and to inform his lordship that he was sending this letter to the public press,\u2014like this Frenchman, the prince played a false game. It was rumoured that he had purposely waited for the solemn occasion of a large evening party at the house of his future bride, at which he was introduced to several eminent persons, in order publicly to make known his ideas and opinions, and thereby insult the \u201cbig-wigs,\u201d and to throw over his bride as offensively as possible; and that, resisting the servants who were told off to turn him out of the house, he had seized and thrown down a magnificent china vase. As a characteristic addition to the above, it was currently reported that the young prince really loved the lady to whom he was engaged, and had thrown her over out of purely Nihilistic motives, with the intention of giving himself the satisfaction of marrying a fallen woman in the face of all the world, thereby publishing his opinion that there is no distinction between virtuous and disreputable women, but that all women are alike, free; and a \u201cfallen\u201d woman, indeed, somewhat superior to a virtuous one.",
            "It was declared that he believed in no classes or anything else, excepting \u201cthe woman question.\u201d",
            "All this looked likely enough, and was accepted as fact by most of the inhabitants of the place, especially as it was borne out, more or less, by daily occurrences.",
            "Of course much was said that could not be determined absolutely. For instance, it was reported that the poor girl had so loved her future husband that she had followed him to the house of the other woman, the day after she had been thrown over; others said that he had insisted on her coming, himself, in order to shame and insult her by his taunts and Nihilistic confessions when she reached the house. However all these things might be, the public interest in the matter grew daily, especially as it became clear that the scandalous wedding was undoubtedly to take place.",
            "So that if our readers were to ask an explanation, not of the wild reports about the prince\u2019s Nihilistic opinions, but simply as to how such a marriage could possibly satisfy his real aspirations, or as to the spiritual condition of our hero at this time, we confess that we should have great difficulty in giving the required information.",
            "All we know is, that the marriage really was arranged, and that the prince had commissioned Lebedeff and Keller to look after all the necessary business connected with it; that he had requested them to spare no expense; that Nastasia herself was hurrying on the wedding; that Keller was to be the prince\u2019s best man, at his own earnest request; and that Burdovsky was to give Nastasia away, to his great delight. The wedding was to take place before the middle of July.",
            "But, besides the above, we are cognizant of certain other undoubted facts, which puzzle us a good deal because they seem flatly to contradict the foregoing.",
            "We suspect, for instance, that having commissioned Lebedeff and the others, as above, the prince immediately forgot all about masters of ceremonies and even the ceremony itself; and we feel quite certain that in making these arrangements he did so in order that he might absolutely escape all thought of the wedding, and even forget its approach if he could, by detailing all business concerning it to others.",
            "What did he think of all this time, then? What did he wish for? There is no doubt that he was a perfectly free agent all through, and that as far as Nastasia was concerned, there was no force of any kind brought to bear on him. Nastasia wished for a speedy marriage, true!\u2014but the prince agreed at once to her proposals; he agreed, in fact, so casually that anyone might suppose he was but acceding to the most simple and ordinary suggestion.",
            "There are many strange circumstances such as this before us; but in our opinion they do but deepen the mystery, and do not in the smallest degree help us to understand the case.",
            "However, let us take one more example. Thus, we know for a fact that during the whole of this fortnight the prince spent all his days and evenings with Nastasia; he walked with her, drove with her; he began to be restless whenever he passed an hour without seeing her\u2014in fact, to all appearances, he sincerely loved her. He would listen to her for hours at a time with a quiet smile on his face, scarcely saying a word himself. And yet we know, equally certainly, that during this period he several times set off, suddenly, to the Epanchins\u2019, not concealing the fact from Nastasia Philipovna, and driving the latter to absolute despair. We know also that he was not received at the Epanchins\u2019 so long as they remained at Pavlofsk, and that he was not allowed an interview with Aglaya;\u2014but next day he would set off once more on the same errand, apparently quite oblivious of the fact of yesterday\u2019s visit having been a failure,\u2014and, of course, meeting with another refusal. We know, too, that exactly an hour after Aglaya had fled from Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s house on that fateful evening, the prince was at the Epanchins\u2019,\u2014and that his appearance there had been the cause of the greatest consternation and dismay; for Aglaya had not been home, and the family only discovered then, for the first time, that the two of them had been to Nastasia\u2019s house together.",
            "It was said that Elizabetha Prokofievna and her daughters had there and then denounced the prince in the strongest terms, and had refused any further acquaintance and friendship with him; their rage and denunciations being redoubled when Varia Ardalionovna suddenly arrived and stated that Aglaya had been at her house in a terrible state of mind for the last hour, and that she refused to come home.",
            "This last item of news, which disturbed Lizabetha Prokofievna more than anything else, was perfectly true. On leaving Nastasia\u2019s, Aglaya had felt that she would rather die than face her people, and had therefore gone straight to Nina Alexandrovna\u2019s. On receiving the news, Lizabetha and her daughters and the general all rushed off to Aglaya, followed by Prince Lef Nicolaievitch\u2014undeterred by his recent dismissal; but through Varia he was refused a sight of Aglaya here also. The end of the episode was that when Aglaya saw her mother and sisters crying over her and not uttering a word of reproach, she had flung herself into their arms and gone straight home with them.",
            "It was said that Gania managed to make a fool of himself even on this occasion; for, finding himself alone with Aglaya for a minute or two when Varia had gone to the Epanchins\u2019, he had thought it a fitting opportunity to make a declaration of his love, and on hearing this Aglaya, in spite of her state of mind at the time, had suddenly burst out laughing, and had put a strange question to him. She asked him whether he would consent to hold his finger to a lighted candle in proof of his devotion! Gania\u2014it was said\u2014looked so comically bewildered that Aglaya had almost laughed herself into hysterics, and had rushed out of the room and upstairs,\u2014where her parents had found her.",
            "Hippolyte told the prince this last story, sending for him on purpose. When Muishkin heard about the candle and Gania\u2019s finger he had laughed so that he had quite astonished Hippolyte,\u2014and then shuddered and burst into tears. The prince\u2019s condition during those days was strange and perturbed. Hippolyte plainly declared that he thought he was out of his mind;\u2014this, however, was hardly to be relied upon.",
            "Offering all these facts to our readers and refusing to explain them, we do not for a moment desire to justify our hero\u2019s conduct. On the contrary, we are quite prepared to feel our share of the indignation which his behaviour aroused in the hearts of his friends. Even Vera Lebedeff was angry with him for a while; so was Colia; so was Keller, until he was selected for best man; so was Lebedeff himself,\u2014who began to intrigue against him out of pure irritation;\u2014but of this anon. In fact we are in full accord with certain forcible words spoken to the prince by Evgenie Pavlovitch, quite unceremoniously, during the course of a friendly conversation, six or seven days after the events at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s house.",
            "We may remark here that not only the Epanchins themselves, but all who had anything to do with them, thought it right to break with the prince in consequence of his conduct. Prince S. even went so far as to turn away and cut him dead in the street. But Evgenie Pavlovitch was not afraid to compromise himself by paying the prince a visit, and did so, in spite of the fact that he had recommenced to visit at the Epanchins\u2019, where he was received with redoubled hospitality and kindness after the temporary estrangement.",
            "Evgenie called upon the prince the day after that on which the Epanchins left Pavlofsk. He knew of all the current rumours,\u2014in fact, he had probably contributed to them himself. The prince was delighted to see him, and immediately began to speak of the Epanchins;\u2014which simple and straightforward opening quite took Evgenie\u2019s fancy, so that he melted at once, and plunged _in medias res_ without ceremony.",
            "The prince did not know, up to this, that the Epanchins had left the place. He grew very pale on hearing the news; but a moment later he nodded his head, and said thoughtfully:",
            "\u201cI knew it was bound to be so.\u201d Then he added quickly:",
            "\u201cWhere have they gone to?\u201d",
            "Evgenie meanwhile observed him attentively, and the rapidity of the questions, their simplicity, the prince\u2019s candour, and at the same time, his evident perplexity and mental agitation, surprised him considerably. However, he told Muishkin all he could, kindly and in detail. The prince hardly knew anything, for this was the first informant from the household whom he had met since the estrangement.",
            "Evgenie reported that Aglaya had been really ill, and that for two nights she had not slept at all, owing to high fever; that now she was better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical state.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that there is peace in the house, at all events,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey never utter a hint about the past, not only in Aglaya\u2019s presence, but even among themselves. The old people are talking of a trip abroad in the autumn, immediately after Adelaida\u2019s wedding; Aglaya received the news in silence.\u201d",
            "Evgenie himself was very likely going abroad also; so were Prince S. and his wife, if affairs allowed of it; the general was to stay at home. They were all at their estate of Colmina now, about twenty miles or so from St. Petersburg. Princess Bielokonski had not returned to Moscow yet, and was apparently staying on for reasons of her own. Lizabetha Prokofievna had insisted that it was quite impossible to remain in Pavlofsk after what had happened. Evgenie had told her of all the rumours current in town about the affair; so that there could be no talk of their going to their house on the Yelagin as yet.",
            "\u201cAnd in point of fact, prince,\u201d added Evgenie Pavlovitch, \u201cyou must allow that they could hardly have stayed here, considering that they knew of all that went on at your place, and in the face of your daily visits to their house, visits which you insisted upon making in spite of their refusal to see you.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014yes, quite so; you are quite right. I wished to see Aglaya Ivanovna, you know!\u201d said the prince, nodding his head.",
            "\u201cOh, my dear fellow,\u201d cried Evgenie, warmly, with real sorrow in his voice, \u201chow could you permit all that to come about as it has? Of course, of course, I know it was all so unexpected. I admit that you, only naturally, lost your head, and\u2014and could not stop the foolish girl; that was not in your power. I quite see so much; but you really should have understood how seriously she cared for you. She could not bear to share you with another; and you could bring yourself to throw away and shatter such a treasure! Oh, prince, prince!\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, yes, you are quite right again,\u201d said the poor prince, in anguish of mind. \u201cI was wrong, I know. But it was only Aglaya who looked on Nastasia Philipovna so; no one else did, you know.\u201d",
            "\u201cBut that\u2019s just the worst of it all, don\u2019t you see, that there was absolutely nothing serious about the matter in reality!\u201d cried Evgenie, beside himself: \u201cExcuse me, prince, but I have thought over all this; I have thought a great deal over it; I know all that had happened before; I know all that took place six months since; and I know there was _nothing_ serious about the matter, it was but fancy, smoke, fantasy, distorted by agitation, and only the alarmed jealousy of an absolutely inexperienced girl could possibly have mistaken it for serious reality.\u201d",
            "Here Evgenie Pavlovitch quite let himself go, and gave the reins to his indignation.",
            "Clearly and reasonably, and with great psychological insight, he drew a picture of the prince\u2019s past relations with Nastasia Philipovna. Evgenie Pavlovitch always had a ready tongue, but on this occasion his eloquence, surprised himself. \u201cFrom the very beginning,\u201d he said, \u201cyou began with a lie; what began with a lie was bound to end with a lie; such is the law of nature. I do not agree, in fact I am angry, when I hear you called an idiot; you are far too intelligent to deserve such an epithet; but you are so far _strange_ as to be unlike others; that you must allow, yourself. Now, I have come to the conclusion that the basis of all that has happened, has been first of all your innate inexperience (remark the expression \u2018innate,\u2019 prince). Then follows your unheard-of simplicity of heart; then comes your absolute want of sense of proportion (to this want you have several times confessed); and lastly, a mass, an accumulation, of intellectual convictions which you, in your unexampled honesty of soul, accept unquestionably as also innate and natural and true. Admit, prince, that in your relations with Nastasia Philipovna there has existed, from the very first, something democratic, and the fascination, so to speak, of the \u2018woman question\u2019? I know all about that scandalous scene at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s house when Rogojin brought the money, six months ago. I\u2019ll show you yourself as in a looking-glass, if you like. I know exactly all that went on, in every detail, and why things have turned out as they have. You thirsted, while in Switzerland, for your home-country, for Russia; you read, doubtless, many books about Russia, excellent books, I dare say, but hurtful to _you_; and you arrived here; as it were, on fire with the longing to be of service. Then, on the very day of your arrival, they tell you a sad story of an ill-used woman; they tell _you_, a knight, pure and without reproach, this tale of a poor woman! The same day you actually _see_ her; you are attracted by her beauty, her fantastic, almost demoniacal, beauty\u2014(I admit her beauty, of course).",
            "\u201cAdd to all this your nervous nature, your epilepsy, and your sudden arrival in a strange town\u2014the day of meetings and of exciting scenes, the day of unexpected acquaintanceships, the day of sudden actions, the day of meeting with the three lovely Epanchin girls, and among them Aglaya\u2014add your fatigue, your excitement; add Nastasia\u2019 s evening party, and the tone of that party, and\u2014what were you to expect of yourself at such a moment as that?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d said the prince, once more, nodding his head, and blushing slightly. \u201cYes, it was so, or nearly so\u2014I know it. And besides, you see, I had not slept the night before, in the train, or the night before that, either, and I was very tired.\u201d",
            "\u201cOf course, of course, quite so; that\u2019s what I am driving at!\u201d continued Evgenie, excitedly. \u201cIt is as clear as possible, and most comprehensible, that you, in your enthusiasm, should plunge headlong into the first chance that came of publicly airing your great idea that you, a prince, and a pure-living man, did not consider a woman disgraced if the sin were not her own, but that of a disgusting social libertine! Oh, heavens! it\u2019s comprehensible enough, my dear prince, but that is not the question, unfortunately! The question is, was there any reality and truth in your feelings? Was it nature, or nothing but intellectual enthusiasm? What do you think yourself? We are told, of course, that a far worse woman was _forgiven_, but we don\u2019t find that she was told that she had done well, or that she was worthy of honour and respect! Did not your common-sense show you what was the real state of the case, a few months later? The question is now, not whether she is an innocent woman (I do not insist one way or the other\u2014I do not wish to); but can her whole career justify such intolerable pride, such insolent, rapacious egotism as she has shown? Forgive me, I am too violent, perhaps, but\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014I dare say it is all as you say; I dare say you are quite right,\u201d muttered the prince once more. \u201cShe is very sensitive and easily put out, of course; but still, she...\u201d",
            "\u201cShe is worthy of sympathy? Is that what you wished to say, my good fellow? But then, for the mere sake of vindicating her worthiness of sympathy, you should not have insulted and offended a noble and generous girl in her presence! This is a terrible exaggeration of sympathy! How can you love a girl, and yet so humiliate her as to throw her over for the sake of another woman, before the very eyes of that other woman, when you have already made her a formal proposal of marriage? And you _did_ propose to her, you know; you did so before her parents and sisters. Can you be an honest man, prince, if you act so? I ask you! And did you not deceive that beautiful girl when you assured her of your love?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, you are quite right. Oh! I feel that I am very guilty!\u201d said Muishkin, in deepest distress.",
            "\u201cBut as if that is enough!\u201d cried Evgenie, indignantly. \u201cAs if it is enough simply to say: \u2018I know I am very guilty!\u2019 You are to blame, and yet you persevere in evil-doing. Where was your heart, I should like to know, your _christian heart_, all that time? Did she look as though she were suffering less, at that moment? You saw her face\u2014was she suffering less than the other woman? How could you see her suffering and allow it to continue? How could you?\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I did not allow it,\u201d murmured the wretched prince.",
            "\u201cHow\u2014what do you mean you didn\u2019t allow?\u201d",
            "\u201cUpon my word, I didn\u2019t! To this moment I don\u2019t know how it all happened. I\u2014I ran after Aglaya Ivanovna, but Nastasia Philipovna fell down in a faint; and since that day they won\u2019t let me see Aglaya\u2014that\u2019s all I know.\u201d",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s all the same; you ought to have run after Aglaya though the other was fainting.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, yes, I ought\u2014but I couldn\u2019t! She would have died\u2014she would have killed herself. You don\u2019t know her; and I should have told Aglaya everything afterwards\u2014but I see, Evgenie Pavlovitch, you don\u2019t know all. Tell me now, why am I not allowed to see Aglaya? I should have cleared it all up, you know. Neither of them kept to the real point, you see. I could never explain what I mean to you, but I think I could to Aglaya. Oh! my God, my God! You spoke just now of Aglaya\u2019s face at the moment when she ran away. Oh, my God! I remember it! Come along, come along\u2014quick!\u201d He pulled at Evgenie\u2019s coat-sleeve nervously and excitedly, and rose from his chair.",
            "\u201cWhere to?\u201d",
            "\u201cCome to Aglaya\u2014quick, quick!\u201d",
            "\u201cBut I told you she is not at Pavlofsk. And what would be the use if she were?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, she\u2019ll understand, she\u2019ll understand!\u201d cried the prince, clasping his hands. \u201cShe would understand that all this is not the point\u2014not a bit the real point\u2014it is quite foreign to the real question.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow can it be foreign? You _are_ going to be married, are you not? Very well, then you are persisting in your course. _Are_ you going to marry her or not?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I shall marry her\u2014yes.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen why is it \u2018not the point\u2019?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, no, it is not the point, not a bit. It makes no difference, my marrying her\u2014it means nothing.\u201d",
            "\u201cHow \u2018means nothing\u2019? You are talking nonsense, my friend. You are marrying the woman you love in order to secure her happiness, and Aglaya sees and knows it. How can you say that it\u2019s \u2018not the point\u2019?\u201d",
            "\u201cHer happiness? Oh, no! I am only marrying her\u2014well, because she wished it. It means nothing\u2014it\u2019s all the same. She would certainly have died. I see now that that marriage with Rogojin was an insane idea. I understand all now that I did not understand before; and, do you know, when those two stood opposite to one another, I could not bear Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s face! You must know, Evgenie Pavlovitch, I have never told anyone before\u2014not even Aglaya\u2014that I cannot bear Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s face.\u201d (He lowered his voice mysteriously as he said this.) \u201cYou described that evening at Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s (six months since) very accurately just now; but there is one thing which you did not mention, and of which you took no account, because you do not know. I mean her _face_\u2014I looked at her face, you see. Even in the morning when I saw her portrait, I felt that I could not _bear_ to look at it. Now, there\u2019s Vera Lebedeff, for instance, her eyes are quite different, you know. I\u2019m _afraid_ of her face!\u201d he added, with real alarm.",
            "\u201cYou are _afraid_ of it?\u201d",

            "\u201cYes, for certain\u2014quite for certain, now! I have discovered it _absolutely_ for certain, these last few days.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat are you doing, then?\u201d cried Evgenie, in horror. \u201cYou must be marrying her solely out of _fear_, then! I can\u2019t make head or tail of it, prince. Perhaps you don\u2019t even love her?\u201d",
            "\u201cOh, no; I love her with all my soul. Why, she is a child! She\u2019s a child now\u2014a real child. Oh! you know nothing about it at all, I see.\u201d",

Oh! if Aglaya only knew all\u2014I mean really, _really_ all! Because she must know _all_\u2014that\u2019s the first condition towards understanding. Why cannot we ever know all about another, especially when that other has been guilty? But I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about\u2014I\u2019m so confused. You pained me so dreadfully. Surely\u2014surely Aglaya has not the same expression now as she had at the moment when she ran away? Oh, yes! I am guilty and I know it\u2014I know it! Probably I am in fault all round\u2014I don\u2019t quite know how\u2014but I am in fault, no doubt. There is something else, but I cannot explain it to you, Evgenie Pavlovitch. I have no words; but Aglaya will understand. I have always believed Aglaya will understand\u2014I am assured she will.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, prince, she will not. Aglaya loved like a woman, like a human being, not like an abstract spirit. Do you know what, my poor prince? The most probable explanation of the matter is that you never loved either the one or the other in reality.\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014perhaps you are right in much that you have said, Evgenie Pavlovitch. You are very wise, Evgenie Pavlovitch\u2014oh! how my head is beginning to ache again! Come to her, quick\u2014for God\u2019s sake, come!\u201d",

            "The wedding was hurried on. The day was fixed for exactly a week after Evgenie\u2019s visit to the prince. In the face of such haste as this, even the prince\u2019s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the hopelessness of any attempt to save \u201cthe poor madman.\u201d Rumour said that in the visit of Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her husband... But if those good souls, in the boundless kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the eccentric young fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger measures to attain that end. Neither their position, nor their private inclination, perhaps (and only naturally), would allow them to use any more pronounced means.",
            "We have observed before that even some of the prince\u2019s nearest neighbours had begun to oppose him. Vera Lebedeff\u2019s passive disagreement was limited to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to more frequent sitting alone at home, and to a diminished frequency in her visits to the prince\u2019s apartments.",
            "Colia was occupied with his father at this time. The old man died during a second stroke, which took place just eight days after the first. The prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and during the first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with Nina Alexandrovna. He went to the funeral, and it was observable that the public assembled in church greeted his arrival and departure with whisperings, and watched him closely.",
            "The same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he went. He was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the name of Nastasia Philipovna coupled with his own as he passed. People looked out for her at the funeral, too, but she was not there; and another conspicuous absentee was the captain\u2019s widow, whom Lebedeff had prevented from coming.",
            "The funeral service produced a great effect on the prince. He whispered to Lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a Russian funeral service since he was a little boy. Observing that he was looking about him uneasily, Lebedeff asked him whom he was seeking.",
            "\u201cNothing. I only thought I\u2014\u201d",

            "\u201cOh, dear, no! Why, they don\u2019t even know him! Anyone can come in, you know. Why do you look so amazed? I often meet him; I\u2019ve seen him at least four times, here at Pavlofsk, within the last week.\u201d",
            "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him once\u2014since that day!\u201d the prince murmured.",
            "As Nastasia Philipovna had not said a word about having met Rogojin since \u201cthat day,\u201d the prince concluded that the latter had his own reasons for wishing to keep out of sight. All the day of the funeral our hero was in a deeply thoughtful state, while Nastasia Philipovna was particularly merry, both in the daytime and in the evening.",
            "Colia had made it up with the prince before his father\u2019s death, and it was he who urged him to make use of Keller and Burdovsky, promising to answer himself for the former\u2019s behaviour. Nina Alexandrovna and Lebedeff tried to persuade him to have the wedding in St. Petersburg, instead of in the public fashion contemplated, down here at Pavlofsk in the height of the season. But the prince only said that Nastasia Philipovna desired to have it so, though he saw well enough what prompted their arguments.",
            "The next day Keller came to visit the prince. He was in a high state of delight with the post of honour assigned to him at the wedding.",

            "\u201cI won\u2019t drink!\u201d",
            "Then he went up to the prince, seized both his hands, shook them warmly, and declared that he had at first felt hostile towards the project of this marriage, and had openly said so in the billiard-rooms, but that the reason simply was that, with the impatience of a friend, he had hoped to see the prince marry at least a Princess de Rohan or de Chabot; but that now he saw that the prince\u2019s way of thinking was ten times more noble than that of \u201call the rest put together.\u201d For he desired neither pomp nor wealth nor honour, but only the truth! The sympathies of exalted personages were well known, and the prince was too highly placed by his education, and so on, not to be in some sense an exalted personage!",

I have even heard talk of getting up a \u2018charivari\u2019 under the windows on the wedding-night. So if \u2018you have need of the pistol\u2019 of an honest man, prince, I am ready to fire half a dozen shots even before you rise from your nuptial couch!\u201d",
            "Keller also advised, in anticipation of the crowd making a rush after the ceremony, that a fire-hose should be placed at the entrance to the house; but Lebedeff was opposed to this measure, which he said might result in the place being pulled down.",
            "\u201cI assure you, prince, that Lebedeff is intriguing against you. He wants to put you under control. Imagine that! To take \u2018from you the use of your free-will and your money\u2019\u2014that is to say, the two things that distinguish us from the animals! I have heard it said positively. It is the sober truth.\u201d",
            "The prince recollected that somebody had told him something of the kind before, and he had, of course, scoffed at it. He only laughed now, and forgot the hint at once.",
            "Lebedeff really had been busy for some little while; but, as usual, his plans had become too complex to succeed, through sheer excess of ardour. When he came to the prince\u2014the very day before the wedding\u2014to confess (for he always confessed to the persons against whom he intrigued, especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that he himself was a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had become simple Lebedeff. He then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince, interesting the latter exceedingly.",
            "According to Lebedeff\u2019s account, he had first tried what he could do with General Epanchin. The latter informed him that he wished well to the unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to \u201csave him,\u201d but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere in this matter. Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him. Prince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and implied that it was no business of theirs. However, Lebedeff had not lost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,\u2014a worthy and respectable man, whom he knew well. This old gentleman informed him that the thing was perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as to Muishkin\u2019s mental incapacity. Then, with the assistance of a few influential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged.",
            "Lebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and carried the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as to whether the thing was to be done or not. The visit was not to be official, but merely friendly.",
            "Muishkin remembered the doctor\u2019s visit quite well. He remembered that Lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at the bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had something to tell the prince about the sick man.",
            "The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a conversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of Hippolyte\u2019s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of his own malady,\u2014of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply was the old man interested by the prince\u2019s conversation and his description of Schneider\u2019s system, that he sat on for two hours.",
            "Muishkin gave him excellent cigars to smoke, and Lebedeff, for his part, regaled him with liqueurs, brought in by Vera, to whom the doctor\u2014a married man and the father of a family\u2014addressed such compliments that she was filled with indignation. They parted friends, and, after leaving the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: \u201cIf all such people were put under restraint, there would be no one left for keepers.\u201d Lebedeff then, in tragic tones, told of the approaching marriage, whereupon the other nodded his head and replied that, after all, marriages like that were not so rare; that he had heard that the lady was very fascinating and of extraordinary beauty, which was enough to explain the infatuation of a wealthy man; that, further, thanks to the liberality of Totski and of Rogojin, she possessed\u2014so he had heard\u2014not only money, but pearls, diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and consequently she could not be considered a bad match. In brief, it seemed to the doctor that the prince\u2019s choice, far from being a sign of foolishness, denoted, on the contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and practical mind. Lebedeff had been much struck by this point of view, and he terminated his confession by assuring the prince that he was ready, if need be, to shed his very life\u2019s blood for him.",
            "Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They lived,\u2014Hippolyte and his mother and the children,\u2014in a small house not far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able to escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his visits.",
            "A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte\u2019s mother came with tears in her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, \u201cor _he_ would eat her up bodily.\u201d She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the invalid begged his visitor to \u201cbeware of Rogojin.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe is the sort of man,\u201d he continued, \u201cwho won\u2019t give up his object, you know; he is not like you and me, prince\u2014he belongs to quite a different order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he won\u2019t be afraid of anything\u2014\u201d and so on.",
            "Hippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive. He was tearful at first, but grew more and more sarcastic and malicious as the interview proceeded.",
            "The prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin. He was anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyte\u2019s vague warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyte\u2019s own private impressions and feelings.",
            "However, the invalid\u2014to his immense satisfaction\u2014ended by seriously alarming the prince.",
            "At first Muishkin had not cared to make any reply to his sundry questions, and only smiled in response to Hippolyte\u2019s advice to \u201crun for his life\u2014abroad, if necessary. There are Russian priests everywhere, and one can get married all over the world.\u201d",
            "But it was Hippolyte\u2019s last idea which upset him.",
            "\u201cWhat I am really alarmed about, though,\u201d he said, \u201cis Aglaya Ivanovna. Rogojin knows how you love her. Love for love. You took Nastasia Philipovna from him. He will murder Aglaya Ivanovna; for though she is not yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,\u2014wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d",
            "He had attained his end. The prince left the house beside himself with terror.",
            "These warnings about Rogojin were expressed on the day before the wedding. That evening the prince saw Nastasia Philipovna for the last time before they were to meet at the altar; but Nastasia was not in a position to give him any comfort or consolation. On the contrary, she only added to his mental perturbation as the evening went on. Up to this time she had invariably done her best to cheer him\u2014she was afraid of his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling him every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall. The prince nearly always pretended to be amused, whether he were so actually or no; but often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the brilliancy of her wit when she was carried away by her narrative, as she very often was. Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the impression she had made, and to hear his laugh of real amusement; and she would remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness. But this evening her melancholy and thoughtfulness grew with every hour.",
            "The prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he loved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul. In his love for her there was the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which cannot be left alone. He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia to anyone, not even to herself. When they were together they never discussed their \u201cfeelings,\u201d and there was nothing in their cheerful, animated conversation which an outsider could not have heard. Daria Alexeyevna, with whom Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had been filled with joy and delight only to look at them, all this time.",
            "Thanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasia\u2019s mental and moral condition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities. She was now quite different from the woman he had known three months before. He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so impatient to marry him\u2014she who formerly had wept with rage and hurled curses and reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage! \u201cIt shows that she no longer fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by marrying me,\u201d he thought. And he felt sure that so sudden a change could not be a natural one. This rapid growth of self-confidence could not be due only to her hatred for Aglaya. To suppose that would be to suspect the depth of her feelings. Nor could it arise from dread of the fate that awaited her if she married Rogojin. These causes, indeed, as well as others, might have played a part in it, but the true reason, Muishkin decided, was the one he had long suspected\u2014that the poor sick soul had come to the end of its forces. Yet this was an explanation that did not procure him any peace of mind. At times he seemed to be making violent efforts to think of nothing, and one would have said that he looked on his marriage as an unimportant formality, and on his future happiness as a thing not worth considering. As to conversations such as the one held with Evgenie Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as possible, feeling that there were certain objections to which he could make no answer.",
            "The prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was to him. He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had caught him starting off for the Epanchins\u2019 house on several occasions. When the Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and happiness. Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at that time that Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene or scandal which would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk. She had encouraged the rumours and excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her marriage with the prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding it difficult to meet the Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion, taken him for a drive past their house. He did not observe what was happening until they were almost passing the windows, when it was too late to do anything. He said nothing, but for two days afterwards he was ill.",
            "Nastasia did not try that particular experiment again. A few days before that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful. She always ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming merry and cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she had been some days earlier.",
            "The prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms. It was a most curious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin. But once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at home, a messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia Philipovna was very ill.",
            "He had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. She screamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there in the garden\u2014that she had seen him herself\u2014and that he would murder her in the night\u2014that he would cut her throat. She was terribly agitated all day. But it so happened that the prince called at Hippolyte\u2019s house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been in town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had made inquiries about Pavlofsk. On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin visited the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia declared that she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing turned out to be an illusion on her part. Nastasia immediately went across to Hippolyte\u2019s to inquire more accurately, and returned immensely relieved and comforted.",
            "On the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of great animation. Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just arrived from town. Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so excited over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her doubly happy.",
            "But Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her wedding splendour. She had heard of the indignation in the town, and knew that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with music, that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the rest of Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations. So, since attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold her head even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the beauty and taste of her toilette. \u201cLet them shout and whistle, if they dare!\u201d Her eyes flashed at the thought. But, underneath this, she had another motive, of which she did not speak. She thought that possibly Aglaya, or at any rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito at the ceremony, or in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for this eventuality.",
            "The prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home. But it was not twelve o\u2019clock when a messenger came to say that Nastasia was very bad, and he must come at once.",
            "On hurrying back he found his bride locked up in her own room and could hear her hysterical cries and sobs. It was some time before she could be made to hear that the prince had come, and then she opened the door only just sufficiently to let him in, and immediately locked it behind him. She then fell on her knees at his feet. (So at least Dana Alexeyevna reported.)",
            "\u201cWhat am I doing? What am I doing to you?\u201d she sobbed convulsively, embracing his knees.",
            "The prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her, at length, pacified and composed. He sent another messenger during the night to inquire after her, and two more next morning. The last brought back a message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of dressmakers and maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty should be on her wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of yesterday\u2019s agitation remaining. The message concluded with the news that at the moment of the bearer\u2019s departure there was a great confabulation in progress as to which diamonds were to be worn, and how.",
            "This message entirely calmed the prince\u2019s mind.",
            "The following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be depended upon, as coming from eye-witnesses.",
            "The wedding was fixed for eight o\u2019clock in the evening. Nastasia Philipovna was ready at seven. From six o\u2019clock groups of people began to gather at Nastasia\u2019s house, at the prince\u2019s, and at the church door, but more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at seven.",
            "Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the prince\u2019s account, but they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal feelings.",
            "There were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only Dana Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor. When the prince asked Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger, Lebedeff replied:",
            "\u201cWhy, he wears an \u2018order,\u2019 and it looks so well!\u201d",
            "This idea amused the prince.",
            "Keller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress-coats and white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers outside.",
            "At about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his carriage.",
            "We may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. He wished all to be done as openly as possible, and \u201cin due order.\u201d",
            "Arrived at the church, Muishkin, under Keller\u2019s guidance, passed through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited exclamations. The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off once more to fetch the bride.",
            "On reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevna\u2019s house, Keller found a far denser crowd than he had encountered at the prince\u2019s. The remarks and exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that Keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their conduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to address them, and hurried indoors.",
            "Nastasia Philipovna was ready. She rose from her seat, looked into the glass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was \u201cas pale as a corpse.\u201d She then bent her head reverently, before the ikon in the corner, and left the room.",
            "A torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. The crowd whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment or two isolated voices were distinguishable.",
            "\u201cWhat a beauty!\u201d cried one.",
            "\u201cWell, she isn\u2019t the first in the world, nor the last,\u201d said another.",
            "\u201cMarriage covers everything,\u201d observed a third.",
            "\u201cI defy you to find another beauty like that,\u201d said a fourth.",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s a real princess! I\u2019d sell my soul for such a princess as that!\u201d",
            "Nastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief; but her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals. The spectators\u2019 cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and triumphant every moment. The door of the carriage was open, and Keller had given his hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with a loud cry she rushed from him, straight into the surging crowd. Her friends about her were stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as she rushed through it, and suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards from the carriage, appeared Rogojin. It was his look that had caught her eyes.",
            "Nastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands.",
            "\u201cSave me!\u201d she cried. \u201cTake me away, anywhere you like, quick!\u201d",
            "Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage. Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and held it to the coachman.",
            "\u201cTo the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another. Quick!\u201d",
            "He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they were off.",
            "\u201cOne more second and I should have stopped him,\u201d said Keller, afterwards. In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was not much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force.",
            "\u201cBesides,\u201d said Burdovsky, \u201cthe prince would not like it, would he?\u201d So they gave up the pursuit.",
            "Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for the train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point of entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the platform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black cloak and a silk handkerchief over her head.",
            "\u201cTake fifty roubles for your cloak?\u201d he shouted, holding the money out to the girl. Before the astonished young woman could collect her scattered senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle, and threw it and the handkerchief over Nastasia\u2019s head and shoulders. The latter\u2019s wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and it was not until some time later that the girl understood why her old cloak and kerchief had been bought at such a price.",
            "The news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary rapidity. When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know thronged around to ask him questions. There was much excited talking, and shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church, all being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would take the news. He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite quietly.",
            "\u201cI was afraid,\u201d he muttered, scarcely audibly, \u201cbut I hardly thought it would come to this.\u201d Then after a short silence, he added: \u201cHowever, in her state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.\u201d",
            "Even Keller admitted afterwards that this was \u201cextraordinarily philosophical\u201d on the prince\u2019s part. He left the church quite calm, to all appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards. He seemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible; but this was not to be. He was accompanied by nearly all the invited guests, and besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited bands of people, who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah. The prince heard Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with these unknown individuals, and soon went out himself. He approached the disturbers of his peace, requested courteously to be told what was desired; then politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed an old gentleman who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of the band of would-be guests, and courteously requested him to honour him with a visit. The old fellow was quite taken aback by this, but entered, followed by a few more, who tried to appear at their ease. The rest remained outside, and presently the whole crowd was censuring those who had accepted the invitation. The prince offered seats to his strange visitors, tea was served, and a general conversation sprang up. Everything was done most decorously, to the considerable surprise of the intruders. A few tentative attempts were made to turn the conversation to the events of the day, and a few indiscreet questions were asked; but Muishkin replied to everybody with such simplicity and good-humour, and at the same time with so much dignity, and showed such confidence in the good breeding of his guests, that the indiscreet talkers were quickly silenced. By degrees the conversation became almost serious. One gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence: \u201cWhatever happens, I shall not sell my property; I shall wait. Enterprise is better than money, and there, sir, you have my whole system of economy, if you wish!\u201d He addressed the prince, who warmly commended his sentiments, though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that this gentleman, who talked so much of his \u201cproperty,\u201d had never had either house or home.",
            "Nearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed to think that it was time to go. As they went out, the doctor and the old gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took their leave with hearty protestations of good-will, dropping remarks to the effect that \u201cit was no use worrying,\u201d and that \u201cperhaps all would turn out for the best,\u201d and so on. Some of the younger intruders would have asked for champagne, but they were checked by the older ones. When all had departed, Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said:",
            "\u201cWith you and me there would have been a scene. We should have shouted and fought, and called in the police. But he has simply made some new friends\u2014and such friends, too! I know them!\u201d",
            "Lebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh:",
            "\u201cThings are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes. I have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has preserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.\u201d",
            "At last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. His head ached. Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his wedding clothes. They parted on affectionate terms, and, without speaking of what had happened, Colia promised to come very early the next day. He said later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him. Soon there was hardly anyone left in the house. Burdovsky had gone to see Hippolyte; Keller and Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere.",
            "Only Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in the rooms. As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. He was seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting on his hands. She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently. The prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember where he was. As recollection dawned upon him, he became violently agitated. All he did, however, was to ask Vera very earnestly to knock at his door and awake him in time for the first train to Petersburg next morning. Vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell anyone of his intention. She promised this, too; and at last, when she had half-closed the door, he called her back a third time, took her hands in his, kissed them, then kissed her forehead, and in a rather peculiar manner said to her, \u201cUntil tomorrow!\u201d",
            "Such was Vera\u2019s story afterwards.",
            "She went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the morning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile, and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. It appears that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone excepting Vera of his departure for town. "

            "\u201cIs Parfen Semionovitch at home?\u201d he asked.",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhy did they tell me he was not at home, then?\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere did they tell you so,\u2014at his door?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo, at his mother\u2019s flat; I rang at Parfen Semionovitch\u2019s door and nobody came.\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, he may have gone out. I can\u2019t tell. Sometimes he takes the keys with him, and leaves the rooms empty for two or three days.\u201d",
            "\u201cDo you know for certain that he was at home last night?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, he was.\u201d",
            "\u201cWas Nastasia Philipovna with him?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know; she doesn\u2019t come often. I think I should have known if she had come.\u201d",
            "The prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the pavement for some time. The windows of all the rooms occupied by Rogojin were closed, those of his mother\u2019s apartments were open. It was a hot, bright day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good look at the windows again; not only were Rogojin\u2019s closed, but the white blinds were all down as well.",
            "He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and Rogojin\u2019s face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however, he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.",
            "The chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he could to Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s lodging. He remembered that, not long since, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her to put up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had well-furnished rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks. Probably Nastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last time; and most likely she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin having taken her straight there from the station.",
            "The prince took a droshky. It struck him as he drove on that he ought to have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin should have taken Nastasia to his own house last night. He remembered that the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still less likely that she would have gone there so late at night.",
            "Vainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince reached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive.",
            "To his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard nothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a marvel of some sort. The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and he was begged to enter. He guessed at once that they knew perfectly well who he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day; and further that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and especially about why he should be here now, inquiring for the woman who in all reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with him in Pavlofsk.",
            "He satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard to the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and sincere that he was obliged to tell the whole story\u2014in a short form, of course. The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince should go at once and knock at Rogojin\u2019s until he was let in: and when let in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything. If Rogojin was really not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain house, the address of which was given, where lived a German lady, a friend of Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s. It was possible that she might have spent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself.",
            "The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse. The good ladies reported afterwards that \u201chis pallor was terrible to see, and his legs seemed to give way underneath him.\u201d With difficulty he was made to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address, in order to act with him if possible. After a moment\u2019s thought he gave the address of the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit some five weeks since. He then set off once more for Rogojin\u2019s.",
            "This time they neither opened the door at Rogojin\u2019s flat nor at the one opposite. The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found, the man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending to be busy. Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to state that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to Pavlofsk, and that he would not return today at all.",
            "\u201cI shall wait; he may come back this evening.\u201d",
            "\u201cHe may not be home for a week.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen, at all events, he _did_ sleep here, did he?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell\u2014he did sleep here, yes.\u201d",
            "All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory. Very likely the porter had received new instructions during the interval of the prince\u2019s absence; his manner was so different now. He had been obliging\u2014now he was as obstinate and silent as a mule. However, the prince decided to call again in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case of need. His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address which he had just received. To that address he now set off at full speed.",
            "But alas! at the German lady\u2019s house they did not even appear to understand what he wanted. After a while, by means of certain hints, he was able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her friend two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither heard nor seen anything of her. He was given to understand that the subject of Nastasia\u2019s present whereabouts was not of the slightest interest to her; and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the world for all she cared! So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly. It struck him now that she might have gone away to Moscow just as she had done the last time, and that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or even _with_ her. If only he could find some trace!",
            "However, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that direction. Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether he would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat down and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining would delay him. Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark passage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy forebodings), and set out once more for Rogojin\u2019s. Rogojin had not returned, and no one came to the door. He rang at the old lady\u2019s door opposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return for three days. The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him again impressed the prince disagreeably. He could not find the porter this time at all.",
            "As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in the stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed, the prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojin\u2019s face could have been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once more to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there. The mother had already been to three or four places to look for Nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind.",
            "The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot understand what is being said to him. It was strange\u2014one moment he seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all the family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and begged to be shown Nastasia\u2019s rooms. The ladies reported afterwards how he had examined everything in the apartments. He observed an open book on the table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the house to take it with him. He had turned down the leaf at the open page, and pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library book. He had then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a card-table, he asked who played cards.",
            "He was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening, either at \u201cpreference\u201d or \u201clittle fool,\u201d or \u201cwhist\u201d; that this had been their practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken to this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting silent and dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after Nastasia had made a remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack of cards out of his pocket. Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began playing. The prince asked where were the cards, but was told that Rogojin used to bring a new pack every day, and always carried it away in his pocket.",
            "The good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojin\u2019s once more\u2014not at once, but in the evening. Meanwhile, the mother would go to Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevna\u2019s whether anything had been heard of Nastasia there. The prince was to come back at ten o\u2019clock and meet her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the morrow.",
            "In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the prince walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through the hot, dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who passed him. Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in his room before he started for Rogojin\u2019s once more. He sat down, rested his elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to thinking.",
            "Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of many things\u2014of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the park, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside, when Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted knife. The prince remembered his enemy\u2019s eyes as they had glared at him in the darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him.",
            "This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him\u2014the prince\u2014before long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here\u2014he had no other town address\u2014perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if all were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if all were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well with him. The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and rushed out towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.",
            "\u201cWhat if he were to come out of that corner as I go by and\u2014and stop me?\u201d thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot. But no one came out.",
            "He passed under the gateway and into the street. The crowds of people walking about\u2014as is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during the summer\u2014surprised him, but he walked on in the direction of Rogojin\u2019s house.",
            "About fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed through the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched his shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:",
            "\u201cLef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.\u201d It was Rogojin.",
            "The prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he had but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of the hotel.",
            "\u201cI was there,\u201d said Rogojin, unexpectedly. \u201cCome along.\u201d The prince was surprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of minutes afterwards, when he began to consider it. Having thought it over, he glanced at Rogojin in alarm. The latter was striding along a yard or so ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically making way for anyone he met.",
            "\u201cWhy did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?\u201d asked the prince, suddenly.",
            "Rogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as though he had not heard the question:",
            "\u201cLook here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall walk on the other side. See that we keep together.\u201d",
            "So saying, Rogojin crossed the road.",
            "Arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the prince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya, and strode on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin understood his instructions. The prince supposed that Rogojin desired to look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had he not told _him_ whom to look out for? So the two proceeded for half a mile or so. Suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause. He could not bear it, and signalled to Rogojin across the road.",
            "The latter came at once.",
            "\u201cIs Nastasia Philipovna at your house?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cAnd was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cThen why did\u2014\u201d",
            "But the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to say. Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult to speak at all. Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before, with an expression of deep thoughtfulness.",
            "\u201cWell, I\u2019m going,\u201d he said, at last, preparing to recross the road. \u201cYou go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the road; it\u2019s better so, you\u2019ll see.\u201d",
            "When they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the prince\u2019s legs were trembling so that he could hardly walk. It was about ten o\u2019clock. The old lady\u2019s windows were open, as before; Rogojin\u2019s were all shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever. Rogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side of the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince across. He went over to the doorway.",
            "\u201cEven the porter does not know that I have come home now. I told him, and told them at my mother\u2019s too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,\u201d said Rogojin, with a cunning and almost satisfied smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll go in quietly and nobody will hear us.\u201d",
            "He had the key in his hand. Mounting the staircase he turned and signalled to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very quietly, let the prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him, and put the key in his pocket.",
            "\u201cCome along,\u201d he whispered.",
            "He had spoken in a whisper all the way. In spite of his apparent outward composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental agitation. Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the window and cautiously beckoned the prince up to him.",
            "\u201cWhen you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went to the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I had told her before that if anyone came and rang\u2014especially you, and I gave her your name\u2014she was not to tell about me. Then I thought, what if he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch the house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you were staring straight at me. That\u2019s how it came about.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhere is Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d asked the prince, breathlessly.",
            "\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause.",
            "\u201cWhere?\u201d",
            "Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince.",
            "\u201cCome,\u201d he said.",
            "He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy. Even while he told the story of how he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing to say something else. They entered the study. In this room some changes had taken place since the prince last saw it. It was now divided into two equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched across it, separating the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojin\u2019s bed, from the rest of the room.",
            "The heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark. The bright Petersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but for the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything in Rogojin\u2019s dismal room, with the drawn blinds. They could just see one anothers faces, however, though not in detail. Rogojin\u2019s face was white, as usual. His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent stare.",
            "\u201cHad you not better light a candle?\u201d said Muishkin.",
            "\u201cNo, I needn\u2019t,\u201d replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he drew him down to a chair. He himself took a chair opposite and drew it up so close that he almost pressed against the prince\u2019s knees. At their side was a little round table.",
            "\u201cSit down,\u201d said Rogojin; \u201clet\u2019s rest a bit.\u201d There was silence for a moment.",
            "\u201cI knew you would be at that hotel,\u201d he continued, just as men sometimes commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside subject before leading up to the main point. \u201cAs I entered the passage it struck me that perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as I was waiting for you. Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky barracks?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes,\u201d said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to the dreadful beating of his heart.",
            "\u201cI thought you would. \u2018They\u2019ll talk about it,\u2019 I thought; so I determined to go and fetch you to spend the night here\u2014\u2018We will be together,\u2019 I thought, \u2018for this one night\u2014\u2019\u201d",
            "\u201cRogojin, _where_ is Nastasia Philipovna?\u201d said the prince, suddenly rising from his seat. He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words came in a scarcely audible whisper. Rogojin rose also.",
            "\u201cThere,\u201d he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain.",
            "\u201cAsleep?\u201d whispered the prince.",
            "Rogojin looked intently at him again, as before.",
            "\u201cLet\u2019s go in\u2014but you mustn\u2019t\u2014well\u2014let\u2019s go in.\u201d",
            "He lifted the curtain, paused\u2014and turned to the prince. \u201cGo in,\u201d he said, motioning him to pass behind the curtain. Muishkin went in.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s so dark,\u201d he said.",
            "\u201cYou can see quite enough,\u201d muttered Rogojin.",
            "\u201cI can just see there\u2019s a bed\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cGo nearer,\u201d suggested Rogojin, softly.",
            "The prince took a step forward\u2014then another\u2014and paused. He stood and stared for a minute or two.",
            "Neither of the men spoke a word while at the bedside. The prince\u2019s heart beat so loud that its knocking seemed to be distinctly audible in the deathly silence.",
            "But now his eyes had become so far accustomed to the darkness that he could distinguish the whole of the bed. Someone was asleep upon it\u2014in an absolutely motionless sleep. Not the slightest movement was perceptible, not the faintest breathing could be heard. The sleeper was covered with a white sheet; the outline of the limbs was hardly distinguishable. He could only just make out that a human being lay outstretched there.",
            "All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were scattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress, bits of lace, ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside glittered a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. From under a heap of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot, which looked as though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was terribly still.",
            "The prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more death-like became the silence. Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed across the room, and settled on the pillow. The prince shuddered.",
            "\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d said Rogojin, touching his shoulder. They left the alcove and sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to one another. The prince trembled more and more violently, and never took his questioning eyes off Rogojin\u2019s face.",
            "\u201cI see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,\u201d said the latter, at length, \u201calmost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; don\u2019t you remember? I don\u2019t know what I shall do with you\u2014\u201d",
            "The prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could muster upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said, and continuing to gaze at the latter\u2019s face.",
            "\u201cWas it you?\u201d he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the curtain.",
            "\u201cYes, it was I,\u201d whispered Rogojin, looking down.",
            "Neither spoke for five minutes.",
            "\u201cBecause, you know,\u201d Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former sentence, \u201cif you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything, they might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that someone was passing the night in the house. They would all come and knock and want to come in, because they know I am not at home. I didn\u2019t light a candle for the same reason. When I am not here\u2014for two or three days at a time, now and then\u2014no one comes in to tidy the house or anything; those are my orders. So that I want them to not know we are spending the night here\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWait,\u201d interrupted the prince. \u201cI asked both the porter and the woman whether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they knew\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cI know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes, and then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here. Last night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I thought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so secretly, but I was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe; she carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldn\u2019t rustle, and she held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldn\u2019t make a noise\u2014it was you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the train, and she begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of taking her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. She said, \u2018No\u2014not there; he\u2019ll find me out at once there. Take me to your own house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow we\u2019ll set off for Moscow.\u2019 Thence she would go to Orel, she said. When she went to bed, she was still talking about going to Orel.\u201d",
            "\u201cWait! What do you intend to do now, Parfen?\u201d",
            "\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid of you. You shudder and tremble so. We\u2019ll pass the night here together. There are no other beds besides that one; but I\u2019ve thought how we\u2019ll manage. I\u2019ll take the cushions off all the sofas, and lay them down on the floor, up against the curtain here\u2014for you and me\u2014so that we shall be together. For if they come in and look about now, you know, they\u2019ll find her, and carry her away, and they\u2019ll be asking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then they\u2019ll take me away, too, don\u2019t you see? So let her lie close to us\u2014close to you and me.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, yes,\u201d agreed the prince, warmly.",
            "\u201cSo we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?\u201d",
            "\u201cNot for anything!\u201d cried the other; \u201cno, no, no!\u201d",
            "\u201cSo I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,\u201d continued Rogojin. \u201cWe\u2019ll be very quiet. I have only been out of the house one hour all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her. I dare say the air is very bad here. It is so hot. Do you find it bad?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014perhaps\u2014by morning it will be.\u201d",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve covered her with oilcloth\u2014best American oilcloth, and put the sheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the smell\u2014as they did at Moscow\u2014you remember? And she\u2019s lying so still; you shall see, in the morning, when it\u2019s light. What! can\u2019t you get up?\u201d asked Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise from his seat.",
            "\u201cMy legs won\u2019t move,\u201d said the prince; \u201cit\u2019s fear, I know. When my fear is over, I\u2019ll get up\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWait a bit\u2014I\u2019ll make the bed, and you can lie down. I\u2019ll lie down, too, and we\u2019ll listen and watch, for I don\u2019t know yet what I shall do... I tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case I\u2014\u201d",
            "Muttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds. It was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he slept on the sofa. But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he seemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another; therefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the sofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain. He then approached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him towards the bed. But the prince could now walk by himself, so that his fear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s hot weather, you see,\u201d continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the cushions beside Muishkin, \u201cand, naturally, there will be a smell. I daren\u2019t open the window. My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots; they have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that old servant will find out, she\u2019s very inquisitive.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, she is inquisitive,\u201d assented the prince.",
            "\u201cI thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was afraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.\u201d",
            "\u201cLook here,\u201d said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain wandered. He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he wished to ask, and then losing them. \u201cListen\u2014tell me\u2014how did you\u2014with a knife?\u2014That same one?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, that same one.\u201d",
            "\u201cWait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of things; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my wedding, at the church door, with your knife?\u201d",
            "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I did or not,\u201d said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be a little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in.",
            "\u201cDid you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?\u201d",
            "\u201cNo. As to the knife,\u201d he added, \u201cthis is all I can tell you about it.\u201d He was silent for a moment, and then said, \u201cI took it out of the locked drawer this morning about three, for it was in the early morning all this\u2014happened. It has been inside the book ever since\u2014and\u2014and\u2014this is what is such a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches at most, just under her left breast, and there wasn\u2019t more than half a tablespoonful of blood altogether, not more.\u201d",
            "\u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014yes\u2014\u201d The prince jumped up in extraordinary agitation. \u201cI know, I know, I\u2019ve read of that sort of thing\u2014it\u2019s internal haemorrhage, you know. Sometimes there isn\u2019t a drop\u2014if the blow goes straight to the heart\u2014\u201d",
            "\u201cWait\u2014listen!\u201d cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up. \u201cSomebody\u2019s walking about, do you hear? In the hall.\u201d Both sat up to listen.",
            "\u201cI hear,\u201d said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin.",
            "\u201cFootsteps?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes.\u201d",
            "\u201cShall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, lock it.\u201d",
            "They locked the door, and both lay down again. There was a long silence.",
            "\u201cYes, by-the-by,\u201d whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as before, as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of losing it again. \u201cI\u2014I wanted those cards! They say you played cards with her?\u201d",
            "\u201cYes, I played with her,\u201d said Rogojin, after a short silence.",
            "\u201cWhere are the cards?\u201d",
            "\u201cHere they are,\u201d said Rogojin, after a still longer pause.",
            "He pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his pocket, and handed them to the prince. The latter took them, with a sort of perplexity. A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart; he had suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long while, he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been acting as he wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his hand, and which he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of no use\u2014no use... He rose, and wrung his hands. Rogojin lay motionless, and seemed neither to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed in the darkness, and were fixed in a wild stare.",
            "The prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. Half an hour went by.",
            "Suddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite forgotten that they must speak in whispers.",
            "\u201cThat officer, eh!\u2014that young officer\u2014don\u2019t you remember that fellow at the band? Eh? Ha, ha, ha! Didn\u2019t she whip him smartly, eh?\u201d",
            "The prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. When Rogojin quieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down beside him, and with painfully beating heart and still more painful breath, watched his face intently. Rogojin never turned his head, and seemed to have forgotten all about him. The prince watched and waited. Time went on\u2014it began to grow light.",
            "Rogojin began to wander\u2014muttering disconnectedly; then he took to shouting and laughing. The prince stretched out a trembling hand and gently stroked his hair and his cheeks\u2014he could do nothing more. His legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. A new sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite anguish.",
            "Meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince lay down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the white, motionless face of Rogojin. His tears flowed on to Rogojin\u2019s cheek, though he was perhaps not aware of them himself.",
            "At all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people thronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever. The prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick man gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling hand over his companion\u2019s hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe and quiet him. But alas! he understood nothing of what was said to him, and recognized none of those who surrounded him.",
            "If Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and patient, remembering the prince\u2019s condition during the first year in Switzerland, he would have flung up his hands, despairingly, and cried, as he did then:",
            "\u201cAn idiot!\u201d "

        "XII.": [
            "This is how it came about that at eleven o\u2019clock next morning Rogojin\u2019s flat was opened by the police in the presence of Lebedeff, the two ladies, and Rogojin\u2019s own brother, who lived in the wing.",
            "The evidence of the porter went further than anything else towards the success of Lebedeff in gaining the assistance of the police. He declared that he had seen Rogojin return to the house last night, accompanied by a friend, and that both had gone upstairs very secretly and cautiously. After this there was no hesitation about breaking open the door, since it could not be got open in any other way.",
            "Rogojin suffered from brain fever for two months. When he recovered from the attack he was at once brought up on trial for murder.",
            "He gave full, satisfactory, and direct evidence on every point; and the prince\u2019s name was, thanks to this, not brought into the proceedings. Rogojin was very quiet during the progress of the trial. He did not contradict his clever and eloquent counsel, who argued that the brain fever, or inflammation of the brain, was the cause of the crime; clearly proving that this malady had existed long before the murder was perpetrated, and had been brought on by the sufferings of the accused.",
            "But Rogojin added no words of his own in confirmation of this view, and as before, he recounted with marvellous exactness the details of his crime. He was convicted, but with extenuating circumstances, and condemned to hard labour in Siberia for fifteen years. He heard his sentence grimly, silently, and thoughtfully. His colossal fortune, with the exception of the comparatively small portion wasted in the first wanton period of his inheritance, went to his brother, to the great satisfaction of the latter.",
            "The old lady, Rogojin\u2019s mother, is still alive, and remembers her favourite son Parfen sometimes, but not clearly. God spared her the knowledge of this dreadful calamity which had overtaken her house.",
            "Lebedeff, Keller, Gania, Ptitsin, and many other friends of ours continue to live as before. There is scarcely any change in them, so that there is no need to tell of their subsequent doings.",
            "Hippolyte died in great agitation, and rather sooner than he expected, about a fortnight after Nastasia Philipovna\u2019s death. Colia was much affected by these events, and drew nearer to his mother in heart and sympathy. Nina Alexandrovna is anxious, because he is \u201cthoughtful beyond his years,\u201d but he will, we think, make a useful and active man.",
            "The prince\u2019s further fate was more or less decided by Colia, who selected, out of all the persons he had met during the last six or seven months, Evgenie Pavlovitch, as friend and confidant. To him he made over all that he knew as to the events above recorded, and as to the present condition of the prince. He was not far wrong in his choice. Evgenie Pavlovitch took the deepest interest in the fate of the unfortunate \u201cidiot,\u201d and, thanks to his influence, the prince found himself once more with Dr. Schneider, in Switzerland.",
            "Evgenie Pavlovitch, who went abroad at this time, intending to live a long while on the continent, being, as he often said, quite superfluous in Russia, visits his sick friend at Schneider\u2019s every few months.",
            "But Dr. Schneider frowns ever more and more and shakes his head; he hints that the brain is fatally injured; he does not as yet declare that his patient is incurable, but he allows himself to express the gravest fears.",
            "Evgenie takes this much to heart, and he has a heart, as is proved by the fact that he receives and even answers letters from Colia. But besides this, another trait in his character has become apparent, and as it is a good trait we will make haste to reveal it. After each visit to Schneider\u2019s establishment, Evgenie Pavlovitch writes another letter, besides that to Colia, giving the most minute particulars concerning the invalid\u2019s condition. In these letters is to be detected, and in each one more than the last, a growing feeling of friendship and sympathy.",
            "The individual who corresponds thus with Evgenie Pavlovitch, and who engages so much of his attention and respect, is Vera Lebedeff. We have never been able to discover clearly how such relations sprang up. Of course the root of them was in the events which we have already recorded, and which so filled Vera with grief on the prince\u2019s account that she fell seriously ill. But exactly how the acquaintance and friendship came about, we cannot say.",
            "We have spoken of these letters chiefly because in them is often to be found some news of the Epanchin family, and of Aglaya in particular. Evgenie Pavlovitch wrote of her from Paris, that after a short and sudden attachment to a certain Polish count, an exile, she had suddenly married him, quite against the wishes of her parents, though they had eventually given their consent through fear of a terrible scandal. Then, after a six months\u2019 silence, Evgenie Pavlovitch informed his correspondent, in a long letter, full of detail, that while paying his last visit to Dr. Schneider\u2019s establishment, he had there come across the whole Epanchin family (excepting the general, who had remained in St. Petersburg) and Prince S. The meeting was a strange one. They all received Evgenie Pavlovitch with effusive delight; Adelaida and Alexandra were deeply grateful to him for his \u201cangelic kindness to the unhappy prince.\u201d",
            "Lizabetha Prokofievna, when she saw poor Muishkin, in his enfeebled and humiliated condition, had wept bitterly. Apparently all was forgiven him.",
            "Prince S. had made a few just and sensible remarks. It seemed to Evgenie Pavlovitch that there was not yet perfect harmony between Adelaida and her fiance, but he thought that in time the impulsive young girl would let herself be guided by his reason and experience. Besides, the recent events that had befallen her family had given Adelaida much to think about, especially the sad experiences of her younger sister. Within six months, everything that the family had dreaded from the marriage with the Polish count had come to pass. He turned out to be neither count nor exile\u2014at least, in the political sense of the word\u2014but had had to leave his native land owing to some rather dubious affair of the past. It was his noble patriotism, of which he made a great display, that had rendered him so interesting in Aglaya\u2019s eyes. She was so fascinated that, even before marrying him, she joined a committee that had been organized abroad to work for the restoration of Poland; and further, she visited the confessional of a celebrated Jesuit priest, who made an absolute fanatic of her. The supposed fortune of the count had dwindled to a mere nothing, although he had given almost irrefutable evidence of its existence to Lizabetha Prokofievna and Prince S.",
            "Besides this, before they had been married half a year, the count and his friend the priest managed to bring about a quarrel between Aglaya and her family, so that it was now several months since they had seen her. In a word, there was a great deal to say; but Mrs. Epanchin, and her daughters, and even Prince S., were still so much distressed by Aglaya\u2019s latest infatuations and adventures, that they did not care to talk of them, though they must have known that Evgenie knew much of the story already.",
            "Poor Lizabetha Prokofievna was most anxious to get home, and, according to Evgenie\u2019s account, she criticized everything foreign with much hostility.",
            "\u201cThey can\u2019t bake bread anywhere, decently; and they all freeze in their houses, during winter, like a lot of mice in a cellar. At all events, I\u2019ve had a good Russian cry over this poor fellow,\u201d she added, pointing to the prince, who had not recognized her in the slightest degree. \u201cSo enough of this nonsense; it\u2019s time we faced the truth. All this continental life, all this Europe of yours, and all the trash about \u2018going abroad\u2019 is simply foolery, and it is mere foolery on our part to come. Remember what I say, my friend; you\u2019ll live to agree with me yourself.\u201d",
            "So spoke the good lady, almost angrily, as she took leave of Evgenie Pavlovitch. "
